xcwx1nm0b,1cd3hlx,1714080829.0,An unfamiliar experience,"(Not white sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways)

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

Thank you if you respond <3

tsbrejk,1ccpg9r,1714044193.0,"Teens up-to GenZ: How do you view Hard Rock, Metal, Punk?","TLDR: It seems like the concept of ""heavy rock"" has receded to the background as only independent/niche music, where ""younger"" ppl now view it as ""older"" person music; whereas into the late '90s - '00s it was the forefront of alt/counter-culture; a completely young person thing to be into. Clearly the audio pendulum has swung to more gentle sounds, but therefore: HOW do younger ppl view the last generation of heavy rock?

I was born in '87, so by the late '90s when I was starting to get into new music on my own, all ""hard rock"" was viewed as being on a constant incline in heaviness and aggressiveness, in a way that seemed to completely refute the older person, mainstream, especially boomer, culture.

See, even though Gen X had grunge, and boomers had 70s and 80s classic rock of their own, that had started to seem tame and calm by comparison.

NEW rock felt like it was getting heavier every year: think ""nu metal"" (Linkin Park, System of a Down, Rage Against thr Machine), and ""Punk/Emo"" (Coheed & Cambria, My Chemical Romance).

In fact, the heaviness and loudness felt like part of a perpetual cultural phenomenon where it was refuting the older gen's rock for an even more aggressive rock.

It felt like an INEXORABLE, INEVITABLE INCLINE in heaviness/loudness/aggressiveness, specifically as a means to say ""fk you older, lamer, less progressive people.""

BUT NOW, in 2024, I realize I haven't seen a hugely popular rock band in... A decade? I only see them at my local dive music venues, and... People over 30.

So clearly, the pendulum has swung culturally. I suppose it was inevitable, since you can only get SO loud before you have to get quieter.

But how do younger people view it? Is it lame? Is it ""just older person"" music? Or, is it ""iconic?"" Is it ""truly classic?""

btw42r84,1ccm38i,1714030776.0,Love songs that rock,"Rock can have different meanings.  As long as it's not too tender or soft.  For example, ""Unchained Melody"" is a great love song, but it certainly does not rock.  ""How Deep is Your Love"" is dope, but it doesn't really rock.  ""More Than Words"" is great, but still, not the kind of song I'm looking for.  ""Can't Buy Me Love"" does it rock?  Technically maybe, but not quite heavy enough.  ""Skinny Love"" by Bon Iver .... not quite heavy enough.  ""True Love Will Find You in the End"" by Daniel Johnston ... not quite heavy enough.  And so on.

Hopefully no low effort. Don't just list a love song that rocks, just because it exists.  List it if it means something to you.

7l62ywd3l,1cclxsx,1714030151.0,Figuring out the Taylor hate.,"My two cents on the hate..

The thing with swift is this. Her music is successful because of the relatitibility of the emotions found in the lyrics. Its written for feelings that a lot of people have. And the words themselves mostly say exactly what they mean.

This also means that if you cant connect with her lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to latch onto. Its about the words. The music is a vessel for her words.

Music like Under Pressure (just the first thing i thought of) often resonates more through the sound of its musical elements like the bassline and the drums rather than the actual meaning of the lyrics. 
The lyrics could have been anything as long as they sound nice. They serve a different function.
Nobody is singing along to under pressure because they relate to the lyrics lol. 

These 2 types of music each offers a different avenue for connection. 

People who like option 2 tend to hate on option 1 because to them it sounds extremely shallow.
And it their worldview that makes perfect sense.
Like I said. Her songs are about the lyrics. So if you dont connect with the lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to them.

vq7m0s3w,1ccj7lp,1714019916.0,What are your thoughts on the Australian rock band Mondo Rock?,"From Wikipedia:

>**Mondo Rock** are an Australian rock band, formed in November 1976 in Melbourne, Victoria. Singer-songwriter Ross Wilson founded the band, following the split of his previous band Daddy Cool. Guitarist Eric McCusker, who joined in 1980, wrote many of the band's hits, and along with Wilson formed the core of the group. They are best known for their second album, *Chemistry*, which was released in July 1981 and peaked at number 2 on the Australian Kent Music Report. Their song ""Come Said the Boy"" peaked at number 2 in Australia in 1983.

>Mondo Rock disbanded in 1991, although they periodically appeared at reunion concerts, and reformed on a more-or-less continuing basis in 2014. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, ""by way of ceaseless touring and the release of a series of sophisticated pop rock albums, \[the band was\] one of the most popular acts in Australia during the early 1980s"". The band had a national tour in 2019, and continues to play occasional dates.

I cannot say I am huge fan but one song of theirs I love to the core is ""State of the Heart"". The feeling of romantic longing and melancholia it evokes is unbeatable. Following lyrics cut straight to my heart, every time I listen to it:

*You are the moon, I am the sea*  
*You pull me in and gaze on down at me*

It has got a fantastic outro as well, with Ross Wilson sort-of howling like a wolf at the moon.

tngnn8vgx,1ccbvdl,1713998353.0,Why I listen bad distortion and artificial sound in many remasters or newer songs after 2017-2018 that they have much loudness?,"Hello, I have this problem. Even if I have checked in a doctor last year, I have no problem of hearing. Then, I have tried many different sets of headphones, but cheap, around 30 euros (like 30 dollars) in different laptops, pcs etc. Yes, 30 euros are very cheap, but also I have tried 2-3 times with headphones of 100 euros of friends and the same problem.

With the older songs I have no problem. But in new songs like Taylor Swift Evermore, Folkrore, Midnights etc it sounds me very strange or in Billie Eilish songs, I can't listen high frequencies and sound is artificial.

Same when I listened these on vinyl without headphones of course from a Technics Turntable in the home of one friend of mine. Same with new remastered vinyls from older Greek classics (I am from Greece), that these re-releases have very loudness, distortion, hard bass and subbass and fake digitized sound. Same with re-releases for first time on vinyl, from late 90s (that never before had released on vinyl). Original vinyls editions from old classics and compact discs released in 90s (from 70s, 80s classics) are so perfect with crystal clear sound, and the majority of Greek and International Music since about 2015.

Finally, I realized that spotify has awful sound and distortion in newer songs!IThey sound overcompressed.I don't understand why and that's the reason I stopped my premium subscription.

dzi29,1cbwige,1713960540.0,Let's talk 'inaccessible' music,"EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I'm not interested in having a slapfight about what albums are hard and what aren't. I'm interested in how people percieve those things. We all know that Disco Volante and Filth and Sing To God and Pulse Demon are difficult listens for a lot of people. 

Discussions about musical inaccessibility often tumble into strange squabbles about who has the most extreme taste, with people touting their own favourites as the really hard stuff and putting others' picks down. Someone calls Kid A a hard album, then someone else tells them that that album is for babies and Trout Mask Replica is a truly difficult experience. A third person enters the conversation and tells the others off, saying that Soundtracks for the Blind is actually hard. And it goes on and on until eventually, someone mentions Merzbow, and that usually shuts the discussion down. 

I don't want that, since one of the more interesting things about this topic is how relative it is. For me, someone who's grown up with free jazz and experimental but listened to very little electronic music, Kid A was initially way harder to listen to than Trout Mask Replica ever was. So let's try to keep a relativistic view on this. 

So, how do you feel about musical difficulty? What difficult albums did you find easy, and what easy albums did you find difficult? And is there even value to calling albums difficult in the first place? What do you think?",Music
1d2xslo,1cbwdcn,1713960094.0,"Being too undiscriminating when it comes to discovery of new music. Where do you draw the lines between forgettable, alright and good?","I have a system of discovering new music. I'm not going to describe it here, but the idea is to force myself out of my comfort zone and listen to music I would normally not listen to. Obviously, I have no problems telling if I really love or hate an album, but the problem is with the stuff somewhere in the middle. Most of the music that ends up on my list is not *bad*. The musicians are competent and there's almost always at least something to like about the albums.

Yesterday, somehow, Cher Lloyd came up in my queue. I'm pretty much the exact opposite of the target audience and I knew the songs wouldn't end up in my playlists, but I would have a hard time calling her a bad artist. It's not for me, but it's alright. On the other side of the spectrum I have artists like Thom Yorke, whose music I can kinda vibe with, but I don't listen to him, because I really don't like his whiny voice.

So the issue is that I find a lot of music ""alright"", but I don't have strong feelings about it. Which becomes a problem when I'm looking for new areas of music to explore. I don't want to waste too much time listening to mediocre music, but I also know that some music I had to push myself to listen to before I started liking it and actively looking for it.

So where do you personally draw the line between what's good and what you know to leave alone?

Alright, so I just finished binge-listening to a bunch of classical operas, and let me tell you, the narrative techniques embedded in the music blew my mind! Like, seriously, I never realized how much storytelling power music holds until now.  
  
Think about it: the way composers use leitmotifs to represent characters or themes throughout the opera is like creating a musical roadmap of the story. It's insane how a simple melody can evoke so much emotion and anticipation.  
  
And don't even get me started on the orchestration! The way different instruments are used to mirror the actions or emotions of the characters adds a whole new layer of depth to the narrative. It's like the music is speaking a language of its own, weaving together the plot in a way that words alone couldn't capture.

r45rhhap,1cbuzb8,1713955347.0,Historical Context of Classical Music and Its Connection to Social Movements Explored.,"Growing up, I used to think classical music was just for fancy occasions or background noise in period dramas. But recently, I stumbled upon a podcast that blew my mind about the historical context of classical music and its ties to social movements. It's crazy how much depth and meaning these seemingly old tunes carry!  
  
The podcast dove into how composers like Beethoven and Mozart weren't just musical geniuses, but also deeply affected by the social and political landscapes of their time. From revolutions to societal upheavals, their compositions often reflected the pulse of the era.  
  
One thing that struck me was how certain pieces were subtly rebellious or even revolutionary in nature, challenging the status quo through music. It made me appreciate classical music in a whole new light ‚Äì it's not just about fancy symphonies, but a reflection of human struggle and triumph.  
  
Have any of you delved into the historical context of classical music? What blew your mind the most?",Music
r45xpty4,1cbutpg,1713954735.0,Musical Devices Depicting Nature in Classical Orchestral Works Analyzed.,"Guys, you know when you're listening to classical music and suddenly you're like, ""Wait, is that a bird chirping?"" Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I've been diving into some of the most famous orchestral pieces lately, and I've noticed something super cool: composers are low-key obsessed with nature sounds.  
  
Take Beethoven's ""Pastoral Symphony,"" for example. Dude practically paints a whole forest with those flutes and clarinets. And don't even get me started on Vivaldi's ""The Four Seasons."" Each movement feels like you're right there in spring, summer, fall, and winter.  
  
But it's not just about birds and rustling leaves. Some composers get pretty creative. Have you heard of Ottorino Respighi's ""Pines of Rome""? Bro, he legit incorporates a recording of a nightingale singing! Talk about next-level immersion.  
  
Anyway, I'm kinda geeking out over here, but I wanna know: What's your favorite classical piece that makes you feel like you're chilling in nature? Let's swap recommendations and vibe together.

r45xpty4,1cbujht,1713953621.0,Relationship Between Tempo and Perceived Expressiveness in Beethoven‚Äôs Symphonies Examined.,"Alright, y'all, let's dive into something pretty cool: the relationship between tempo and perceived expressiveness in Beethoven's symphonies.  I've always been a huge fan of classical music, and Beethoven's work has a special place in my heart.  
  
So, here's the deal: I stumbled upon this study that delves into how the tempo of a piece affects how expressive we think it is. Like, imagine listening to the same symphony, but one version is played a bit faster than the other. Would you feel the same emotions from both?   
  
Turns out, researchers found some fascinating results. They played different recordings of Beethoven's symphonies to participants at varying tempos and asked them to rate the expressiveness. And guess what? The tempo had a significant impact on how people perceived the music! It's wild how something as subtle as speed can change our emotional response.  
  
I'm curious, what do you all think about this? Have you ever noticed how tempo affects your experience with music? ",Music

5b7qgw1u,1cbtq2m,1713950172.0,The Downward Spiral (1994)... wow.,"I'll admit it right away - I'm not someone who listens to full albums. I'm more of a singles guy.

There is, quite literally, only a handful of albums that I've actually listened to in their entirety.

As of yesterday evening, the newest addition to that handful is Nine Inch Nails' *The Downward Spiral.*

I had read stuff about how it tells a story of a man who feels broken and helpless all the time and all that, and eventually unalives himself.

Supposedly, that album was also one of the inspirations for Chuck Palahniuk to write *Fight Club.*

So, I was convinced.

Had it been some previous time in my life that I first listened to this, I would've probably considered it mid, with quite a lot of songs being fillers, especially ""Mr. Self Destruct"", ""Heresy"", and ""I Do Not Want This"".

But now, that I've been through some tough shit in my life, I completely understand it.

Trent Reznor had to let all his inner demons out. He just had to.

It's one thing to seemingly be aware of all the raging, unpleasant, horrifying thoughts that reside in another human being's head.

It's something entirely else to see it for yourself what those thoughts actually are.

Lastly, the closing track is ""Hurt"".

A lot of things about this track has already been said. Namely, without that track, this album would feel like just another industrial rock album, and just another album in general.

And of course, that song probably means a lot to some people personally. Yes, that version, not Johnny Cash's version.

But there is another track that helps to have this album removed from being just another typical depressing, helpless album.

That track is ""A Warm Place"". In the context of the whole album, its interpretation might be that of some false hope, inside the guy's mind.

It's not until that false hope proves to be just that - a false hope - that the ground is set for events that lead to ""Hurt"".

All in all, an incredible album. One that, if you've been through some really tough shit in your life, you'll find *very* relatable.",Music

I am looking for people to text with either on telegram or discord to share with music that we like in common. However, I don't (really) listen to mainstream music or popular rock covers, they just do not click with me.

I really prefer the deep archive, catchy stuff from bygone eras - in particular, jazz and rock from the 50's, 60's & 70's. The stuff I listen to is often singles and knockoff covers by no-name bands and studio artists that failed to make any impact and hit the charts, and typically only have a couple thousand (or hundred) views on YouTube, if any. 

Some of these artists I like include Jim Oertling, Ray Batts, The P.K. Limited, The Aquarian Age, and many others.

I also enjoy bluegrass and old-style country, including sub-genres like honky-tonk, hillbilly and (notably) ragtime jazz such as Joe ""Fingers"" Carr.

My brother, who's 19 and heading to music university soon, has an incredible knack for the piano it seems. He's self-taught on guitar since age 8 and has recently taken to the piano with astonishing ease. On guitar, he played the original Scarborough Fair at age 9 for his school concert. Despite his intuitive talent, he lacks formal training and struggles with structure when creating music. On the first day of sitting down at the piano, from memory and intuition, he played most of 'Rondo Alla Turca' at full speed. And then Braveheart, some Beethoven etc etc.  
It's been 2 weeks and he's incredibly fast now. 



He goes up and down the piano each day for hours, spontaneously creating melody after melody (he appears to be doing scale runs up and down and then wherever he lands he'll make a melody from his head in real time and full speed and then if it falls on a triad or note from a classical piece or pop song he remembers, he'll use that chord and either play it spontaneously, or he'll change the notes a little or use certain techniques from that song to create a new one), and he hasn't learned any theory or notation.

bqvdx,1cbg6kd,1713906911.0,Having trouble finding thrash metal bands that are *actually* similar to Metallica and Megadeth,"I've found it challenging to find other bands (either modern or from the 80's / 90s) that have the same approach to thrash metal as the Metallica or Megadeth, probably the most well-known of thrash metal groups. I am trying to find a very specific mix of qualities that both those groups in their heyday at least managed to exemplify:

1. Rhythm Guitar riffs that are catchy and hook-oriented. Not just blasting chaos riffage, but creating fun riffs like on ""Master of Puppets,"" and ""Blackened"" and ""Killing Is My Business""
2. No screamo / hardcore / gutteral growling vocals. Intelligible lyrics that are sung more or less in a melody.
3. Groove-oriented drum parts. *Minimal* double-kick-drum pounding or repetitive punk-style 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2 beats.
4. Technically impressive guitar solos that are central to the presentation of the songs.

Admittedly I've got a very narrow criteria for what I'm looking for, but there must be a few more groups out there who fit this bill. Pantera is probably the closest and I also think some White Zombie songs qualify. But Pantera gets a little to hardcore-ish after Cowboys from Hell and White Zombie are just kind of their own thing. I like Slayer but they're also a bit too much into the hyper-chaos sound barrage zone for me too often.

youxcfeq2,1cb7b74,1713885680.0,In Defence of Videogame Music,"I preface the whole post by emphasizing that videogame music ‚Äì or any kind of music, really ‚Äì doesn't need any sort of justification whatsoever to be respectable. The title is merely a play on the idea some people have that it does actually need to be protected or mocked for some reason. It's just music; It's just sounds, or lack of thereof, or whatever your definition of it is. The appreciation for any form of perceptive experience is contextual and highly personal, and whatever the narrative or historical context for these works is, it can still elicit responses from those who come in contact with them. That should be all a potential listener should care about, on a human level, as a basic default.   
  
I write this also to clarify some of my positions I didn't fully explore in one of my previous posts in regard to game music in general, which I think might be of interest to other people. That post made reference to classical music and was directed to those who were already familiar with it, hence the different location of it compared to this one. A main focus of it was that most of game music isn't ""structurally"" complex in the same vein of classical music, which isn't to say it's not complex at all. There are many considerations to be made when crafting a fitting soundscape for a game, which far surpass the intentions and worries of the single composer. When such a big team is included in the creation process of a single piece of music, it's role in the title, it's aesthetic and emotional necessities, it cannot merely be reduced to being ""simple"". In short, there exist many kinds of ""complex"" troubles a game piece has to deal with before finally managing to properly come into existence.  
  
A track might be repetitive, monodic, segmentent, but as long as it fits the purpose it had initially planned to accomplish, it can be defined as functionally fine. That's enough. That's perfect. There is nothing less, and nothing more to it. There is no point in holding specific kinds of music to standards they never even considered to reach in the first place. It's certainly not the piece's fault, nor the composer's. People can do only what the circumstances asks them to, and act accordingly.  
  
I am fully aware some people do indeed, genuinely, berate game music for being structurally simple, or for being derivative of already established traditions. Personally, I see nothing wrong with not being utterly original all the time, or at all. I see the role of art is to recontextualize informations, to make one aware of the presence, existence, and role of certain concepts. To make them aware of and intensify their own humanity. If a commonly used chord progression suddenly gets a new personal and emotional meaning for you, whatever it is, it's already art to me, and to you. Art is context. It made your life a tiny bit more self-conscious and aware of your surroundings. You got closer to the intense and full rounded experience any human being can achieve and obtain endless joy and fullfilment through. I think it's beautiful, even if it's game music compared to, say, Hans Abrahamsen's 'Let me Tell you', or a piece by Brett Dean, or ‚Äì which incidentally was discussed recently by a major contemporary classical music divulgator, Samuel Andreyev, despite being a relatively ""simple"" and accessible work ‚Äì Rafael Toral's 'Spectral Evolution'.  
  
Music doesn't need to be complex to be moving, in the broad sense; and it doesn't need to be complex to be art. A lot of currently recognized as artistic works are rather structurally simple, and this is true for classical music as it is for pop, rock, or noise music. So: game music is art, in it's own way; go, listen to it, celebrate it, be proud of it! And never feel timid about wanting to simply enjoy life as much as possible. You are human, and all we want is to express ourselves and experience the world intensely, with no regrets, with all our souls.  
  
On a different tangent, as this is a sort of continuation to the previous post I mentioned, videogame music is not ""classical music""; but it doesn't need to be in order to be considered first of all as legitimate, and then, again, as art.  
  
It's not classical music because it's not part of that direct lineage of traditions from which the great Western European composers of the past were part of. This, of course, has nothing to do with a lot of it's most popular works being Japanese. We already have a lot of globally recognized japanese and oversea classical music, in the form of Yoshimatsu, Takemitsu, Unsuk Chin, Wang Xilin, Tan Dun, etc, to limit myself to Asia and name just a few. Those composers, compared to videogame music ones, are directly inspired and completely aware of their influences rooted in the same ""music theory"" tradition that influenced the great classical composers of the past. What they write might be very different, but their background finds it's origin in those same traditions and, overtime, has reacted to it in completely deliberate ways, which is different from the passive approach of soundtrack writing, where some aesthetic and functional aspects of it are used simply because of the necessities of the market.  
  
The composer has little say in personal expression in these works, which is instead another focal point of traditional classical music writing. I expanded on this and other points in another comment I wrote previously, but I will be happy to reiterate them if enough people are curious about it. This post, however, is not about the case of videogame music being or not classical music specifically. My point is: videogame soundtracks are not ""classical music"", but that doesn't make them any less deserving to be featured in concert halls and so be able to touch the heartstrings of players and enthusiasts alike in novel and reinvigorating ways. If anything, I expect them to! I welcome it. In the meanwhile, they can indeed also act as ""genre gateways"" of sorts.  
  
I will repeat the note of my last post: I am not an elitist. I made sure to spell it out very clearly back there, but it seems some people of relevance still misinterpreted it, which, honestly, might still be on me, as I don't actually plan or think my posts through. They really are just mere flows of thoughts.

I can't think of any other big critic toward videogame music right now, but if you have any in mind let me know. I am sure there are valid and ultimately personal ones, but as far as the ones I brought up are concerned I don't feel they are that stable. Of course, fellow vgm listeners are completely aware of the value of the music from the industry already; they don't need to be reassured of it most of the time. This is for those who are somewhat uncertain about where they stand with their opinions on the specific topics I brought up I guess.

I will make sure to edit the post if any interesting additional inputs are shared.",Music

bb00iuzw,1cb76t7,1713885374.0,"My 3 favorite and least favorite performances in ""We are the world""","I am not old enough to have seen this when it came about, but I'm familiar with many of these artists- though it's my first time seeing most of their faces.

**Favorites**

1. **Cyndi Lauper**

Literally nobody had more enthusiasm in this than Cyndi Lauper. From her ""whoa whoa WHOA"" buildup, to when she starts singing in the background over other singers, she's absolutely entertaining the entire time.

2) **Stevie Wonder**

I know he's blind so his dancing was partially so enthusiastic because he never saw anyone else dance, but I love every moment he's in this. Stevie Wonder, in this like the rest of his music, was feeling the groove, and I love it.

3) **Daryl Hall**

He had like 5 seconds of screen time, and in that time he hit like 15 different totally correct notes, all with this absolutely fantastic vibrato. No notes Daryl. No notes at all.

**Least Favorites**

1) **Michael Jackson**

I think in a song dedicated to helping the less fortunate, it was sort of tasteless for MJ to show up with a diamond studded glove and gold lined parade outfit while literally everyone else was dressed fairly modestly. I get that he helped write the song, but like... so did Lionel Richie and Lionel didn't take the opportunity to get a camera zoom in of his entire outfit. He even put on shades in the second full scene he gave himself.

There's a crowd scene later where everyone else is singing the chorus and Michael Jackson (who had another costume change) looks behind him while everyone is singing, mouths something like ""bwa bwo"", then turns around and doesn't sing.

2) **Billy Joel**

I don't know that this really highlighted Billy Joel very well, which is fair, there are a lot of people, but I think Billy Joel is at his strongest when there's a piano in front of him, and this didn't really give him a chance to show off.

3) **Bob Dylan**

Again, I get that his style is to not sing, but he sounds like he's meant to be giving a speech in the intermission, or like... he's reading the words for the first time at a funeral he's really upset about.

I don't know if he's the voice I'd end the group chorus on.",Music

But I don‚Äôt know if I should mod it or buy a new guitar with an already set and distinct sound to itself.

If I was to buy a new guitar it would be between an Epiphone Firebird, A Fender Stratocaster, or a Jagstang. (Assume that I would buy most of these used)

If I was too mod my Squier I would change the tuners to some gotoh tuners, a gotoh 510 bridge or vegatram (both are floating bridges), change the chrome and silver parts to gold. The pickups would go something like this, a Les Paul humbucker at the neck pickup, a reverse lipstick tele pickup in the middle, and a mini humbucker on the bridge pickup. If I have to settle between having a humbucker on both neck and bridge or mini humbucker in neck and bridge I would choose the mini humbucker if I can‚Äôt have both separate pickups.

Hey group.

Hoping for help from someone with a wider knowledge of the genre.

About a month ago, a song played on my phone that I meant to get the name of for future listening.  I stupidly thought I'd remember to look at the song info when I got out of the car but alas!

I've been hearing the song in my head without knowing enough of it to search it on Google with any accuracy.

The song is by a female artist, most likely Irish.

Subject of the song is a marriage which is strained because the husband is in love with a man but is trying to either hide it or not admit it.

The wife isn't mad, more sad that he couldn't love her the same way.

A part of the lyrics mention that he talks about this guy when he's sleeping.  Another part I think mentions that she just wants him to.look at her the way he looks at this other man.

It's like, on one hand, it's great to see indie artists getting recognition and making some cash doing what they love. But then, there's this nagging feeling that maybe something pure is being lost in the process, you know?

I mean, when a band goes from playing tiny clubs to headlining huge festivals sponsored by big corporations, it's hard not to wonder if their message gets diluted along the way. Are they still singing from the heart, or just trying to please the masses and line their pockets?

Then there's the whole issue of authenticity. Can a band maintain their indie cred once they start partnering with major labels and appearing in flashy ads? Or does it all become just another product to be sold?

I'm not saying there's a right or wrong answer here, but I'm curious what y'all think. Has the commercialization of indie music brought about positive change, or are we witnessing its slow degradation? ",Music

Not to mention Fred actually has a really nice singing voice. For a couple examples of personal favorites The One, Re-Arranged, Boiler, and I especially like the cover of Behind Blue Eyes they did. These aren‚Äôt the songs people usually picture when they hear Limp Bizkit, but they are just as important as any other song. I think a lot of the good parts of their catalogue get skimmed over for the tracks that are the basic, everybody knows songs. A lot of these songs show a very vulnerable and upset Fred Durst. All he did was express how he truly felt, which is what art is all about. Idk maybe it‚Äôs just me ,but I think LB and Fred deserve more respect than they get.

The song Ari Ari chants ""*baby baby baby, fuck you baby baby baby I want to fuck fuck you baby baby, fuck you baby baby baby*"". Swearing is normal in pop these days world wide, but back then it was not. Especially in Korea. 

Throbbing Gristle's ""[*20 Jazz Funk Greats*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NERfJl0vNI9MyrblzdWLx?si=9ab3b88660944e66)"" didn't trick me because I already knew the song hamburger lady. So when I saw that album I remember being like ""*fuck off y'all made a normal album*"" üòÇ

Mylene Farmer has this very silly song called ""[On est tous des imb√©ciles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_est_tous_des_imb%C3%A9ciles)"" the B-Side on this single ""*L'Annonciation*"" is insanely dark.

Making them only internet famous for the most part. I'll start:

1. Ice spice
2. Yeat
3. SoFaygo (never reached a major level but has a major hit that definitely wouldn't be popular without tiktok)

Artists that fit in this category typically have hit songs that blow up extremely quickly then have a plateau effect where the songs are no longer streamed. That's because the popularity of those songs is strongly correlated with the popularity of the sound on tiktok and other platforms. In other words the song isn't actually great, and generally it's only played by the audience consuming the content on social media.

There's a certain style of music, particularly of guitar, that I've heard. The two best examples I can think of are the Eagles' Tequila Sunrise and Warren Zevon's Carmelita. The guitar solos in both of these songs have the characteristics of this style most heavily, but the whole songs are kind of in that vein.

I know these are technically ""country rock"" songs but  I feel like the style is evocative of Mexico/Texas/Southwest and cowboys. I'd imagine these songs and others like them were inspired by a certain genre of music, I feel almost certain for some reason that it's Hispanic.

What genres do these guitar solos (and the songs as a whole) sound most similar to? The closest I've found is Flamenco, which shares a lot of characteristics, but is definitely not it.

I am starting a band with some of my friends and i was wondering about some advice. We are all students in college, and several of us have been in various bands with one another for about a year now, and so we have decided to combine the core members of these bands into one, more serous band. I am the drummer in this new band, and i am looking for advice on a drum kit to buy. Without getting into too much drama, one of the bands that we were in got our practice space (and school owned drum kit) taken away from us. For that reason, we are getting an apartment on campus together next year so that we can have a practice space. However wanting to be courteous neighbors, we are looking to remain quiet so we have picked up a ton of sound panelling. We have also invested in an audio mixer that we can plug into and run headphones out of so that we can practice while being significantly quieter than we were being before with our practice space in the music building. I am looking into getting a drum kit for these sessions, and possible gigs (there are several bars in town that host live music every weekend) however due to the circumstances i am leaning towards getting an E-Kit. Budget is about $1000 for the kit, for this reason i was looking into getting the millennium mps-1000. I have a rug for the drum kit and other equipment. Any advice for the situation? Any advice for the drum kit? I am not completely settled on the kit and i can stretch the budget $200ish more.

xtrkk,1cacbt4,1713796336.0,"Can someone please explain the Beyonc√© acclaim? (Not a hate post, I promise)","I really like Destiny's Child a lot. Their music was fun and silly often to the point of being outright comical. There's not a lot of music out there like that. And Beyonc√© always was the standout among the group, rightfully positioned up front. She's a charismatic performer with strong vocal talent.

I haven't loved most of her solo music as much, but I did like her earlier music.

I also admire her more recent album concepts. I appreciate that she creates wholly conceived albums, and I appreciate the ideas that have driven the Lemonade, Renaissance and Country Carter albums.

As a gay man who came of age in the 90s, I particularly looked forward to the Renaissance album...but then I ultimately found it unlistenable because of the lyrics, which by and large are absolute nonsense as far as my ears can hear. Not ""good nonsense"" (for my taste, all things being subjective) like Destiny's Child, but more self-serious nonsense that has potential to be funny but isn't presented in a way that seems to be meant to be funny.

The lyrics...

>Ass gettin' bigger

>Racks gettin' bigger

>Cash gettin' larger

>He thought he was loving me good, I told him, ""Go harder""

>She thought she was killin' that shit, I told her, ""Go harder""

>Just look at this alkaline wrist 'cause I got that water

>Ass getting thiquer

>Cash getting thiquer

>That's that thique, that's that real shit

>That's that jelly, baby, champagne and cherry, baby

>That's that thique, that's that ball drop

>That's that keep going, that's that never stop

>That's that thique, that's that na-na, that oochy coochy, la, la

>Yeah, this that Fiji agua, candy girl pi√±ata

>Hit it in the car and take you back to the casa

>Bet I got you rock now, that thique all over the yacht, now

>That's that freaknik, that's that 1996

>That's that moon Miami bass, 12 in the trunk 808

>Uh, that's that Castro, eat that shit like Mastro's

>She say she on a diet, girl, you better not lose that ass, though

As the kids say, ""I just can't.""

I really can't get into her music.

And that's OK, of course. I absolutely accept that all taste is subjective and I don't condemn anyone for their creative output.

My criticism, really, is of critics‚Äîbecause I just can't understand the universal acclaim of her music because of the lyrics. Metacritic gives Renaissance, the album from which the lyrics above come (and of which they are pretty representative) an average score of 91/100‚Äîuniversal acclaim.

Notoriously hypercritical magazine *Pitchfork* gave it a 9/10 and wrote this about it:

>Renaissance is a commanding prescription to be perceived again, without judgment. Listening to the album, you can feel the synapses coming back together one by one

...which absolutely baffles me.

Can anyone explain what I am missing? I'd like to be able to appreciate Beyonc√©'s work but I am just bewildered. In all honesty.

Also, the song ""Thique,"" quoted above, credits three writers.

The lead song on her new album, Country Carter, credits THIRTEEN writers. Thirteen writers!

As I mentioned, I came of age in the 1990s, when women singer-songwriters dominated a major share of the music scene, and most of those extraordinary talents composed their own music, sang their own music without pitch correction, performed their own music, and wrote their own lyrics *without any cowriters*. Some such as Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Regina Spektor, have continued to work this way for all these decades, and it's really hard for me to understand most of today's current artists who are universally praised for their songwriting when all of their songs are written by committees of cowriters, and some of their song lyrics seem to be to be pure gibberish without any insight whatsoever.

So I ask again, in all earnestness, can someone explain Beyonc√©'s work to me in a way that will help me to appreciate her as a songwriter, and help me to overlook the seeming superficiality of her lyrics to understand the treasures that seemingly every critic can see so easily?",Music

This was someone in their 60s with quite a wide range of musical taste.

I find I completely disagree with their take. 

I typically am a full album listener - I will still throw playlists on often enough, but I love sitting and listening to an album in full. Because of this, songs that I may not initially love tend to grow on me, and I find it pretty common to be able to listen to and enjoy every song on a given album by an artist that I enjoy.

3fgxpge6,1ca7x8y,1713784072.0,Need Advice Regarding Drummer Who Speeds Up,"Hello chaps - hope this is allowed.  
I currently play in a blues-rock trio. (Myself on bass, R on guitar and H on drums)

We used to have J on drums but he wanted to play different music, so we parted amicably and recruited H instead.

Interestingly, when J was in the band we used to shy away from faster/swing type numbers as his drumming noticeably slowed down 1 or 2 bars into the song.  
Now, with H, we have a new love for this sort of material as he can keep the quick tempo in a way that J never could.



This is where I need some advice - it's not noticeable on every song, but semi-regularly, H will speed up.

I want to make it clear we're all happy with how things are - I'd rather a drummer that speeds up rather than one who slows down. You can teach a drummer to relax, rather than coach a drummer to increase his stamina so he can speed up (J never really had a desire to practise on his own and we always used to settle for 'good enough')



Has anyone ever had success in getting a drummer to relax and slow down? Is this something that will come with time? We made good progress on slow blues numbers, so that now they don't speed up. It's just some songs like Spoonful (Howling Wolf/Willie Dixon cover) will noticeably speed up.

Thanks for reading that far and thankyou in advance for your thoughts!",Music

I fulfill marketing functions and I sincerely want to do something good for them since they have helped me a lot and I really see that they work very hard for quality content. Studying the company, I think that what they need is a good community as well as for them to be more involved with their audience. I think it is possible on Reddit. They have shown me that the community that consumes this type of music is quite welcoming and good, so I wanted to try and ask the experts. So here goes: how would you like to see this type of content? (UgS carries out interviews, recommendations, reports, etc.) I would like it to be in a super pleasant and friendly way as if you were talking to a friend, to reach that type of relationship. Not invasive spam at all. On the other hand, would you be interested in reading its content and giving it a try? I recommend the last interview they did with GdZilla, which I found very interesting.

yp8t1t174,1ca6nc0,1713779122.0,What is the name of these sounds in songs? ,"Dumb questions to follow, I'm a music enthusiastic but I have never studied sound engineering lol 

There's a certain type of sound in these following songs that gives me goosebumps and it just makes my brain go all fuzzy and fun like a dopamine hit. Idk if it's a certain instrument it sounds amazing.

These are following examples and the time frames within the songs:

- Everywhere - Fleetwood Mac (the introduction - sounds like crystals or something fiddling together)

- Book of Miracles (Instrumental) - Fleetwood Mac (Basically has that similar vibe to Everywhere)

- Baby Be Mine - Michael Jackson (0:04-0:06, appears again at 0:13-0:16)  - souds sort of angelic and funky but only lasts a few seconds)

- Da Ya Think I'm Sexy? - Rod Steward (0:18-0:34)

- Girlfriend - Michael Jackson (Basically introduction until 0:13)

- Caribbean Queen - Billy Ocean (0:03-0:09)

- Cheri Cheri Lady - Modern Talking (0:11-0:17)
 

There's also another element of songs..  It happens when someone's singing and there's kind of like a faint background singer that accompanies the main singer. Idk if that's just called a harmony or whether there's something more to it?

These are examples once again for this aspect:

- The Riddle - Nick Kershaw (the chorus e.g. 1:56-2:14)

- California Dreamin' - The Mamas & The Papas - (1:08-1:16)

- Don't Look Back - Cutting Crew (0:42-0:44, 0:50-0:52, 1:01-1:04)

- Down on Love - Foreigner (1:19-1:24, 1:29-1:34)

- Dreamlover - Mariah Carey (1:18-1:38) - kind of just a backup vocal but still sounds nice and dreamy

- Someday - Mariah Carey (1:02-1:10)

- Party All the Time - Eddie Murphy (1:01-1:04, 1:14-1:23)

- Rhiannon - Fleetwood Mac (1:22-1:50)

- Here comes the sun - The Beatles (basically when they sing 'here comes the sun' & 'It's alright'

- Caribbean Blue - Enya (Basically the whole song haha)
 

They are only small increments of songs, but it really makes the songs way more enjoyable.

f5tq1brv,1ca42ie,1713768464.0,I want to talk about Van Halen.,"Tonight I put on my Sennheisers and loaded up Van Halen's Diver Down album.

This has always been my favorite Van Halen record, and tonight I remembered why I love Rock n Roll.

First off, If you have never listened to this album front to back on a decent sound system, you are missing out.

Every element, from Alex and his drumming right through to DLR is exactly on point and tight as fuck.

And Eddie, oh my god, Eddie slays it on every single track. I also don't think Michael Anthonies' bass has ever been better than on this album.

I have never really understood why this album has not been acclaimed as their best ever. It is so damn solid that it leaves me struck with the feeling that Damn I love Rock Music.

Most people I know would argue that Sammy Hagars Van Halen is best, and on some levels, I am tempted to agree.



Take Diver Down for a spin on your best sound system, and tell me I'm wrong.

It's hitting me hard because I've been revisiting some old playlists lately and damn, the nostalgia is real. It's like each song is a time capsule, bringing back memories and emotions I thought I'd forgotten.  
  
I've been thinking about how certain songs can transport you back to a specific moment in time, almost like time travel but with a killer soundtrack. It's wild how music has this power to evoke such strong feelings and memories. Whether it's a breakup anthem that still stings or a feel-good jam that instantly lifts your spirits, there's something magical about the way music can touch your soul.

I mean, think about it: in a song, those brief pauses can build anticipation, add depth, or create a sense of rhythm that's just chef's kiss. It's like they're the punctuation marks in the melody's sentence.  
  
But it's not just in music, right? Silence has this incredible ability to communicate emotions, thoughts, and intentions in all aspects of life.

y85vtv9s1,1c9zoqf,1713753144.0,Is Taylor Swift hurting her Reputation prior to her Reputation (Taylor's Version) Release,"Whether intentional or not I believe recent moves by Taylor Swift might hurt her reputation prior to her release of 'Reputation - Taylor's Version.' Below are examples of such:

1. Releasing too much music. When the Tortured Poets Department leaked a day and half early, I listened to the 17 track album (16  + 1 Bonus) multiple times and believed she was a genius. She went deep on gossip subjects and with each listen I felt like I was unlocking some new understanding. I couldn't determine whether the material was autobiographical or works of fiction, but this made it that much more engaging. When I woke up the next morning to 14 more tracks I felt a little overwhelmed. The first 17 tracks, while fun and engaging, they also carried a little heaviness. The next 14 tracks tipped the scale and made the album, at least at this time, unlistenable for me. I did listen to to the additional tracks but it just felt like it was too much, too heavy, and too fictionalized. 

2. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) applied at the wrong time. I understand an artist's desire to push down negative feedback and discussions about them and their work, but when you release an album of controversial work, people want to discuss it. I found it especially difficult to find controversial takes and theories about her songs. If you try to post a hot take/discussion on the Taylor Swift Reddit page it gets auto removed. Now maybe this is by design, otherwise pages might get spammed with negative posts, but there should be some place for discussion/gossip to occur. 

3. She might have too much exposure. It's hard to say there can ever be too much exposure when I'm just as guilty as the next person to click on whatever Taylor Swift article pops in my news thread, but it does feel like this is the most she has ever been in the news.

4. Her business domination is causing other artists to take notice and leak their frustration. When Billie Eilish complained earlier this year about the number of variants artists were releasing it was assumed she was talking about Taylor Swift. It's possible that Taylor Swift has upped the business game so much that it is truly impossible for other artists to compete. This in turn could create overall negative emotions toward her from other artists.

5. The Jolene effect could eventually come to bite her. Taylor Swift now has enough songs to fill a whole album about being a Jolene. While all these songs are assumed to be fictional, at some point a story could emerge that the songs were actually biographical. This would more than likely cause a hit to Taylor's Reputation.

Taylor has thus far shown her genius in the music and business realms, even with what appears to be possible missteps, when it is all said and done, it may actually be intentional. For Taylor Swift's Reputation (Taylor Version) to feel fresh again maybe some controversy could help. ",Music

jh5d6nij,1c9xnzu,1713746893.0,What songs/albums do you love musically but despise lyrically or for other creative decisions?,"I'll start: Portugal. The Man - ""Chris Black Changed My Life""

I've listened to this album probably 100 times since it came out last year, and even though my enjoyment of the music and overall vibe has grown, my hatred for the lyrics, sample choices, and blatantly repurposed melodies lifted from other Jeff Bhasker songs and elsewhere has deepened. 

People say that their previous album ""Woodstock"" was over-produced pop garbage but at least Danger Mouse didn't let them use cringey samples or other songs' already-overused melodies... I'm aware that music is primarily marketed to teens who buy CDs and records and the producer may have decided to go full money-making corporatism but it's a bit much on this record.

It got me wondering, do people typically decide not to listen to albums they love and hate, or do they just cringe through for the sections they like? 

What are your examples of this ""phenomenon""?


Examples of the lifted melodies:

Dummy's chorus (1,2,3,4) is melodically identical (and lyrically for the counting part) to that song in the movie ""get him to the greek"" where rose byrne sings about anal sex, as well as Feist obviously.

Summer of Luv's chorus is identical to the chorus of Kanye's ""Hell of A Life"" (another Jeff Bhasker-produced song)




Examples of terrible creative choices:

Dummy: making a beat out of someone saying ""duh"" as if they're mentally challenged is such a weird kind of gross decision

Ghost Town: calling people NPCs and talking about crypto...

The beginning of Thunderdome: ""all the little gatos lose their cabeza this time of year year year"" is god-awful.

Doubt: great song with cinderblocks tied to its legs. Also the song is named after the (x) doubt meme...

The end of ""Champ"" with the sudden completely new song that sounds sampled from a live show - i appreciate the sentiment but god damn the words they chose to say it are so bad.

The ending of the album ""why don't you go to fuckin disneyland and build a monument to your delusional thinking"" and the following ""just breathe there is another breath"" just make me think of r/im14andthisisdeep

They sort of feel like cheap tricks with little thought

Apparently, grooving to your favorite tunes isn't just good for the soul, it's like a workout for your brain too.  
  
So, here's the scoop: studies suggest that learning to play an instrument can boost memory, enhance spatial reasoning, and even improve language skills. It's like a secret weapon for leveling up your brainpower! But get this ‚Äì even just listening to music can have some serious benefits.  
  
Turns out, jamming out to Mozart might make you a math whiz (or at least help you ace that next test). And those catchy beats you love? They could be giving your brain a little extra boost, helping you focus and stay sharp.  
  
I don't know about you, but I'm definitely going to crank up the tunes a bit more often now. Who knew that jamming out could be so good for you? Anyway, what's your take on this? Do you feel like music has had an impact on your cognitive skills?",Music

any suggestions would be appreciated, again to be noted i have no knowledge of any string instruments to begin with, so based on your experience suggest me with what would be easier for me? (i know it‚Äôs subjective) but still, bass guitar or electric guitar?

ps: i was considering on starting with drums because it‚Äôs the instrument i really wanted to learn always but it‚Äôs too expensive for me.

Have you ever stopped to think about how your favorite playlists on Spotify are curated just for you? That's AI at work, folks! It's not just about recommending tunes; it's about understanding your taste on a whole new level.

Of course, there are skeptics out there who think AI will never replace the creativity of human musicians. And hey, I get it. There's something magical about the human touch in music. But I can't help but wonder, what if AI and humans collaborate? Could we create something even more mind-blowing?

The Working Hour by Tears for Fears is my pick. It‚Äôs such a confronting, notable 6 minutes of music.

Curt and Roland‚Äôs voices (I always thought it was just Curt singing, but a Google search says otherwise. I should probably learn to distinguish their voices lol) are deliciously fluctuating and continuously hit exactly what they need to. Every overlaying sound is just so PERFECT.

I get comfort from the knowledge that the people I envy are capable of making horrible mistakes.

[Giddy Up! -The Hives](https://youtu.be/JyEfrJabyCM?si=UkdC3S5CiARG1LAK): the inspiration for this post. I've been going through their (very good!!!) discography lately and when I reached this song today I laughed so hard I almost threw up. I've never heard a worse guitar solo in my life, and because this band is generally good at guitar sections I'm half convinced they did this as a joke

[Choke (Acoustic) - iDKHOW](https://youtu.be/3nUHKduzero?si=M6cniGdfCCWcbLtg): this isn't acoustic. It's really scary actually. From the eerie piano and pounding percussion, this song is what being dragged to hell would feel like. It almost circles around to being good in an atmospheric way but I can't listen to it without getting anxiety :(

[Twenties - Ghost](https://youtu.be/nQ-pxlKgiTI?si=DZUbRiZS9cA0acUs): I like Ghost so much that their worst song isn't even that terrible. There are people who like this one but I find the monotonal chorus really boring and annoying.

xcwx1nm0b,1cd3hlx,1714080829.0,An unfamiliar experience,"(Not white sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways)

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

Thank you if you respond <3

Great lyrics with amazing production is just a nice bonus. Making MUSIC isn't just lyricism and although it's a crucial part it's still a piece of MUSIC so it still has to SOUND good sonically. If the vocals are dull and not outgoing I simply have a harder time listening to it because I love vocalist and if I'm listening to an album and the voice and production sounds the same all throughout it gets pretty boring. Whitney Houston's most known song is a cover I Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton and she elevated that song with her vocals.  ,Music

Also, doesn't have to be a band. Could be a singer, a rapper, or whatever.

And I understand determining an official band for places like LA or California generally would probably be impossible, but surely less ""on the map"" places do. 

For example, I'm in The Granite State aka New Hampshire and we'd probably claim Aerosmith in a statewide vote, but Ronnie James Dio was born in Portsmouth, NH so I'd personally rather claim Dio.

But what a lot of people might not know is we're also the birthplace of some noteworthy punk bands like The Bruisers and The Queers, and, unfortunately depending on your perspective, GG Allin.

Perhaps our greatest claim to fame? Arguably the worst band of all-time: The Shaggs! If you don't know their ""hit"" My Pal Foot Foot, I implore you to give it a listen and understand that the deaf may be the fortunate ones.

tsbrejk,1ccpg9r,1714044193.0,"Teens up-to GenZ: How do you view Hard Rock, Metal, Punk?","TLDR: It seems like the concept of ""heavy rock"" has receded to the background as only independent/niche music, where ""younger"" ppl now view it as ""older"" person music; whereas into the late '90s - '00s it was the forefront of alt/counter-culture; a completely young person thing to be into. Clearly the audio pendulum has swung to more gentle sounds, but therefore: HOW do younger ppl view the last generation of heavy rock?

I was born in '87, so by the late '90s when I was starting to get into new music on my own, all ""hard rock"" was viewed as being on a constant incline in heaviness and aggressiveness, in a way that seemed to completely refute the older person, mainstream, especially boomer, culture.

See, even though Gen X had grunge, and boomers had 70s and 80s classic rock of their own, that had started to seem tame and calm by comparison.

NEW rock felt like it was getting heavier every year: think ""nu metal"" (Linkin Park, System of a Down, Rage Against thr Machine), and ""Punk/Emo"" (Coheed & Cambria, My Chemical Romance).

In fact, the heaviness and loudness felt like part of a perpetual cultural phenomenon where it was refuting the older gen's rock for an even more aggressive rock.

It felt like an INEXORABLE, INEVITABLE INCLINE in heaviness/loudness/aggressiveness, specifically as a means to say ""fk you older, lamer, less progressive people.""

BUT NOW, in 2024, I realize I haven't seen a hugely popular rock band in... A decade? I only see them at my local dive music venues, and... People over 30.

So clearly, the pendulum has swung culturally. I suppose it was inevitable, since you can only get SO loud before you have to get quieter.

But how do younger people view it? Is it lame? Is it ""just older person"" music? Or, is it ""iconic?"" Is it ""truly classic?""

7l62ywd3l,1cclxsx,1714030151.0,Figuring out the Taylor hate.,"My two cents on the hate..

The thing with swift is this. Her music is successful because of the relatitibility of the emotions found in the lyrics. Its written for feelings that a lot of people have. And the words themselves mostly say exactly what they mean.

This also means that if you cant connect with her lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to latch onto. Its about the words. The music is a vessel for her words.

Music like Under Pressure (just the first thing i thought of) often resonates more through the sound of its musical elements like the bassline and the drums rather than the actual meaning of the lyrics. 
The lyrics could have been anything as long as they sound nice. They serve a different function.
Nobody is singing along to under pressure because they relate to the lyrics lol. 

These 2 types of music each offers a different avenue for connection. 

People who like option 2 tend to hate on option 1 because to them it sounds extremely shallow.
And it their worldview that makes perfect sense.
Like I said. Her songs are about the lyrics. So if you dont connect with the lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to them.

Check the date at the closest not sold out venue, it‚Äôs a weekday but whatever. I‚Äôll make it work. Tickets aren‚Äôt too crazy, and since I‚Äôll be staying with a friend, I figure I‚Äôll get them one too. Just in case they want to tag along. Put two GA tickets in my cart, go to check out‚Ä¶

Thats insanity. How is this legal? I remember being able to go to a concert for $20. That‚Äôs it. Buy it at the venue, no fees, great time. Now it doesn‚Äôt matter who it is, a single ticket all in is over $60, and that‚Äôs on a good day. I hate what the world is now.

vq7m0s3w,1ccj7lp,1714019916.0,What are your thoughts on the Australian rock band Mondo Rock?,"From Wikipedia:

>**Mondo Rock** are an Australian rock band, formed in November 1976 in Melbourne, Victoria. Singer-songwriter Ross Wilson founded the band, following the split of his previous band Daddy Cool. Guitarist Eric McCusker, who joined in 1980, wrote many of the band's hits, and along with Wilson formed the core of the group. They are best known for their second album, *Chemistry*, which was released in July 1981 and peaked at number 2 on the Australian Kent Music Report. Their song ""Come Said the Boy"" peaked at number 2 in Australia in 1983.

>Mondo Rock disbanded in 1991, although they periodically appeared at reunion concerts, and reformed on a more-or-less continuing basis in 2014. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, ""by way of ceaseless touring and the release of a series of sophisticated pop rock albums, \[the band was\] one of the most popular acts in Australia during the early 1980s"". The band had a national tour in 2019, and continues to play occasional dates.

I cannot say I am huge fan but one song of theirs I love to the core is ""State of the Heart"". The feeling of romantic longing and melancholia it evokes is unbeatable. Following lyrics cut straight to my heart, every time I listen to it:

*You are the moon, I am the sea*  
*You pull me in and gaze on down at me*

It has got a fantastic outro as well, with Ross Wilson sort-of howling like a wolf at the moon.

r2w2emjj,1cciwxz,1714018879.0,Aesthetics and Visual Imagery in Metal Music: Embodying Power through Striking Album Art and Electrifying Stage Performances .,"Alright folks, let's dive deep into the visual side of metal music. You ever just stare at an album cover and feel the sheer power pulsating from it? Or witness a stage performance that sends shivers down your spine with its electrifying visuals? That's what I'm talking about!  
  
Metal isn't just about the music; it's a whole sensory experience. The way album covers depict dark and fantastical imagery, often intertwined with symbolism, can transport you to another world before you even hit play. And let's not forget about those stage shows! From elaborate sets to pyrotechnics that light up the night, metal bands know how to put on a spectacle.  
  
But what is it about these visuals that captivate us? Is it the raw emotion they convey, or the way they amplify the music's intensity? I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Share your favorite album covers or memorable stage performances that left you in awe.",Music

I've been diving deep into the world of metal lately, and let me tell you, the connections I've found are mind-blowing! From Scandinavian black metal to Japanese visual kei, the fusion of different cultures has created some seriously epic sonic landscapes.  
  
Take a band like Babymetal, for example. They blend metal with J-pop in a way that shouldn't work, but somehow totally does. And it's not just about the music itself. The internet has played a huge role in connecting metalheads from every corner of the globe. We're swapping music, sharing influences, and breaking down barriers like never before.  
  
But it's not all rainbows and unicorns. Globalization has also led to some heated debates about cultural appropriation and authenticity. Where do we draw the line between appreciation and appropriation? It's a tricky question, and one that doesn't have an easy answer.  
  
So, what are your thoughts? How has globalization impacted the metal scene in your opinion? ",Music

Ever wondered how metal music came to be?  Let's take a journey through its wild evolution together! From the gritty depths of Black Sabbath's pioneering sound to the shredding solos of Iron Maiden, metal has morphed into a beast with countless heads.  But where did it all start? Some say it emerged from the fiery depths of blues and rock, while others point to the rebellious spirit of punk. And let's not forget the influence of classical music in those epic symphonic metal ballads!  
  
But it doesn't stop there. Metal's family tree is as twisted and gnarled as its riffs. Thrash, doom, death, power ‚Äì each branch brings its own flavor to the mosh pit. And let's not forget about the more obscure cousins like folk metal and djent!

Even if I have checked in a doctor last year, I have no problem of hearing. Then, I have tried many different sets of headphones, but cheap, around 30 euros (like 30 dollars) in different laptops, pcs etc. Yes, 30 euros are very cheap, but also I have tried 2-3 times with headphones of 100 euros of friends and the same problem.

With the older songs I have no problem. But in new songs like Taylor Swift Evermore, Folkrore, Midnights etc it sounds me very strange or in Billie Eilish songs, I can't listen high frequencies and sound is artificial.

Same when I listened these on vinyl without headphones of course from a Technics Turntable in the home of one friend of mine. Same with new remastered vinyls from older Greek classics (I am from Greece), that these re-releases have very loudness, distortion, hard bass and subbass and fake digitized sound. Same with re-releases for first time on vinyl, from late 90s (that never before had released on vinyl). Original vinyls editions from old classics and compact discs released in 90s (from 70s, 80s classics) are so perfect with crystal clear sound, and the majority of Greek and International Music since about 2015.

It sounds a lot better than what we had then of course but I am amazed how long this sound endures.

It isn't even a matter of how accurate the material is to eighties sounds or themes anymore.  I'm not sure it's a differentiator anymore.  Like Dua Lipa entire career seems built on that sound.  The Weekend too.

There is also the song by Nina Simone- I Pull A Spell On You, which is classified as Jazz, but I can't see the first example in that way and I can't find any musical genre that fits this style.

Even Suno's predecessors music, back when prototypes were made, albeit the products are very boring and generic, you couldn't possibly tell whether it is made by a human or not. As a composer myself, I am scared of the possibilities that this may cause. 

I personally think that the exploitation of the ambiguity of music for relentless mass production without consequences is just saddening to think about. How could you even tell that an A.I made a track? Even if the producer was caught use (more likely admit using) an A.I, aside from mass boycotting maybe, they wouldn't face any legal repercussion at all.

dzi29,1cbwige,1713960540.0,Let's talk 'inaccessible' music,"EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I'm not interested in having a slapfight about what albums are hard and what aren't. I'm interested in how people percieve those things. We all know that Disco Volante and Filth and Sing To God and Pulse Demon are difficult listens for a lot of people. 

Discussions about musical inaccessibility often tumble into strange squabbles about who has the most extreme taste, with people touting their own favourites as the really hard stuff and putting others' picks down. Someone calls Kid A a hard album, then someone else tells them that that album is for babies and Trout Mask Replica is a truly difficult experience. A third person enters the conversation and tells the others off, saying that Soundtracks for the Blind is actually hard. And it goes on and on until eventually, someone mentions Merzbow, and that usually shuts the discussion down. 

I don't want that, since one of the more interesting things about this topic is how relative it is. For me, someone who's grown up with free jazz and experimental but listened to very little electronic music, Kid A was initially way harder to listen to than Trout Mask Replica ever was. So let's try to keep a relativistic view on this. 

So, how do you feel about musical difficulty? What difficult albums did you find easy, and what easy albums did you find difficult? And is there even value to calling albums difficult in the first place? What do you think?",Music
1d2xslo,1cbwdcn,1713960094.0,"Being too undiscriminating when it comes to discovery of new music. Where do you draw the lines between forgettable, alright and good?","I have a system of discovering new music. I'm not going to describe it here, but the idea is to force myself out of my comfort zone and listen to music I would normally not listen to. Obviously, I have no problems telling if I really love or hate an album, but the problem is with the stuff somewhere in the middle. Most of the music that ends up on my list is not *bad*. The musicians are competent and there's almost always at least something to like about the albums.

Yesterday, somehow, Cher Lloyd came up in my queue. I'm pretty much the exact opposite of the target audience and I knew the songs wouldn't end up in my playlists, but I would have a hard time calling her a bad artist. It's not for me, but it's alright. On the other side of the spectrum I have artists like Thom Yorke, whose music I can kinda vibe with, but I don't listen to him, because I really don't like his whiny voice.

So the issue is that I find a lot of music ""alright"", but I don't have strong feelings about it. Which becomes a problem when I'm looking for new areas of music to explore. I don't want to waste too much time listening to mediocre music, but I also know that some music I had to push myself to listen to before I started liking it and actively looking for it.

So where do you personally draw the line between what's good and what you know to leave alone?

Alright, so I just finished binge-listening to a bunch of classical operas, and let me tell you, the narrative techniques embedded in the music blew my mind! Like, seriously, I never realized how much storytelling power music holds until now.  
  
Think about it: the way composers use leitmotifs to represent characters or themes throughout the opera is like creating a musical roadmap of the story. It's insane how a simple melody can evoke so much emotion and anticipation.  
  
And don't even get me started on the orchestration! The way different instruments are used to mirror the actions or emotions of the characters adds a whole new layer of depth to the narrative. It's like the music is speaking a language of its own, weaving together the plot in a way that words alone couldn't capture.

But recently, I stumbled upon a podcast that blew my mind about the historical context of classical music and its ties to social movements. It's crazy how much depth and meaning these seemingly old tunes carry!  
  
The podcast dove into how composers like Beethoven and Mozart weren't just musical geniuses, but also deeply affected by the social and political landscapes of their time. From revolutions to societal upheavals, their compositions often reflected the pulse of the era.  
  
One thing that struck me was how certain pieces were subtly rebellious or even revolutionary in nature, challenging the status quo through music. It made me appreciate classical music in a whole new light ‚Äì it's not just about fancy symphonies, but a reflection of human struggle and triumph.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I've been diving into some of the most famous orchestral pieces lately, and I've noticed something super cool: composers are low-key obsessed with nature sounds.  
  
Take Beethoven's ""Pastoral Symphony,"" for example. Dude practically paints a whole forest with those flutes and clarinets. And don't even get me started on Vivaldi's ""The Four Seasons."" Each movement feels like you're right there in spring, summer, fall, and winter.

Turns out, researchers found some fascinating results. They played different recordings of Beethoven's symphonies to participants at varying tempos and asked them to rate the expressiveness.

5b7qgw1u,1cbtq2m,1713950172.0,The Downward Spiral (1994)... wow.,"I'll admit it right away - I'm not someone who listens to full albums. I'm more of a singles guy.

There is, quite literally, only a handful of albums that I've actually listened to in their entirety.

As of yesterday evening, the newest addition to that handful is Nine Inch Nails' *The Downward Spiral.*

I had read stuff about how it tells a story of a man who feels broken and helpless all the time and all that, and eventually unalives himself.

Supposedly, that album was also one of the inspirations for Chuck Palahniuk to write *Fight Club.*

So, I was convinced.

Had it been some previous time in my life that I first listened to this, I would've probably considered it mid, with quite a lot of songs being fillers, especially ""Mr. Self Destruct"", ""Heresy"", and ""I Do Not Want This"".

But now, that I've been through some tough shit in my life, I completely understand it.

Trent Reznor had to let all his inner demons out. He just had to.

It's one thing to seemingly be aware of all the raging, unpleasant, horrifying thoughts that reside in another human being's head.

It's something entirely else to see it for yourself what those thoughts actually are.

Lastly, the closing track is ""Hurt"".

A lot of things about this track has already been said. Namely, without that track, this album would feel like just another industrial rock album, and just another album in general.

And of course, that song probably means a lot to some people personally. Yes, that version, not Johnny Cash's version.

But there is another track that helps to have this album removed from being just another typical depressing, helpless album.

That track is ""A Warm Place"". In the context of the whole album, its interpretation might be that of some false hope, inside the guy's mind.

It's not until that false hope proves to be just that - a false hope - that the ground is set for events that lead to ""Hurt"".

All in all, an incredible album. One that, if you've been through some really tough shit in your life, you'll find *very* relatable.",Music

It's insane how something as seemingly straightforward as harmony can have such a profound impact on the overall feel and emotion of a piece.  
  
I never realized just how much nuance goes into crafting those lush chord progressions and how they interact with the melodies and counterpoint. Seriously, it's like a whole intricate dance of tones and textures that weave together to create a rich sonic tapestry.  
  
But here's the kicker: dissecting harmony isn't just about understanding the technical stuff. It's about feeling the music on a deeper level and appreciating the genius of composers who were able to harness its power to evoke all sorts of emotions.

My brother, who's 19 and heading to music university soon, has an incredible knack for the piano it seems. He's self-taught on guitar since age 8 and has recently taken to the piano with astonishing ease. On guitar, he played the original Scarborough Fair at age 9 for his school concert. Despite his intuitive talent, he lacks formal training and struggles with structure when creating music. On the first day of sitting down at the piano, from memory and intuition, he played most of 'Rondo Alla Turca' at full speed. And then Braveheart, some Beethoven etc etc.  
It's been 2 weeks and he's incredibly fast now. 



He goes up and down the piano each day for hours, spontaneously creating melody after melody (he appears to be doing scale runs up and down and then wherever he lands he'll make a melody from his head in real time and full speed and then if it falls on a triad or note from a classical piece or pop song he remembers, he'll use that chord and either play it spontaneously, or he'll change the notes a little or use certain techniques from that song to create a new one), and he hasn't learned any theory or notation. But because he has no structure, it's just melody after melody, but NO FULL SONGS. He's constantly 'writing music in his head' as he says.

  
I believe he could benefit from some foundational theory and technique to channel his intuition more effectively and collaborate with other musicians. Any suggestions on where he should start? I don't want his gift to go to waste. Thanks in advance for your advice!",Music

I am trying to find a very specific mix of qualities that both those groups in their heyday at least managed to exemplify:

1. Rhythm Guitar riffs that are catchy and hook-oriented. Not just blasting chaos riffage, but creating fun riffs like on ""Master of Puppets,"" and ""Blackened"" and ""Killing Is My Business""
2. No screamo / hardcore / gutteral growling vocals. Intelligible lyrics that are sung more or less in a melody.
3. Groove-oriented drum parts. *Minimal* double-kick-drum pounding or repetitive punk-style 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2 beats.
4. Technically impressive guitar solos that are central to the presentation of the songs.

Admittedly I've got a very narrow criteria for what I'm looking for, but there must be a few more groups out there who fit this bill. Pantera is probably the closest and I also think some White Zombie songs qualify. But Pantera gets a little to hardcore-ish after Cowboys from Hell and White Zombie are just kind of their own thing. I like Slayer but they're also a bit too much into the hyper-chaos sound barrage zone for me too often.

Listening to these two maestros side by side, I noticed distinct differences in how they craft their melodies. Bach's intricate and precise compositions seem to follow a more structured pattern, almost like a mathematical equation unfolding in musical form. On the other hand, Mozart's melodies feel more fluid and emotionally charged, with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.

youxcfeq2,1cb7b74,1713885680.0,In Defence of Videogame Music,"I preface the whole post by emphasizing that videogame music ‚Äì or any kind of music, really ‚Äì doesn't need any sort of justification whatsoever to be respectable. The title is merely a play on the idea some people have that it does actually need to be protected or mocked for some reason. It's just music; It's just sounds, or lack of thereof, or whatever your definition of it is. The appreciation for any form of perceptive experience is contextual and highly personal, and whatever the narrative or historical context for these works is, it can still elicit responses from those who come in contact with them. That should be all a potential listener should care about, on a human level, as a basic default.   
  
I write this also to clarify some of my positions I didn't fully explore in one of my previous posts in regard to game music in general, which I think might be of interest to other people. That post made reference to classical music and was directed to those who were already familiar with it, hence the different location of it compared to this one. A main focus of it was that most of game music isn't ""structurally"" complex in the same vein of classical music, which isn't to say it's not complex at all. There are many considerations to be made when crafting a fitting soundscape for a game, which far surpass the intentions and worries of the single composer. When such a big team is included in the creation process of a single piece of music, it's role in the title, it's aesthetic and emotional necessities, it cannot merely be reduced to being ""simple"". In short, there exist many kinds of ""complex"" troubles a game piece has to deal with before finally managing to properly come into existence.  
  
A track might be repetitive, monodic, segmentent, but as long as it fits the purpose it had initially planned to accomplish, it can be defined as functionally fine. That's enough. That's perfect. There is nothing less, and nothing more to it. There is no point in holding specific kinds of music to standards they never even considered to reach in the first place. It's certainly not the piece's fault, nor the composer's. People can do only what the circumstances asks them to, and act accordingly.  
  
I am fully aware some people do indeed, genuinely, berate game music for being structurally simple, or for being derivative of already established traditions. Personally, I see nothing wrong with not being utterly original all the time, or at all. I see the role of art is to recontextualize informations, to make one aware of the presence, existence, and role of certain concepts. To make them aware of and intensify their own humanity. If a commonly used chord progression suddenly gets a new personal and emotional meaning for you, whatever it is, it's already art to me, and to you. Art is context. It made your life a tiny bit more self-conscious and aware of your surroundings. You got closer to the intense and full rounded experience any human being can achieve and obtain endless joy and fullfilment through. I think it's beautiful, even if it's game music compared to, say, Hans Abrahamsen's 'Let me Tell you', or a piece by Brett Dean, or ‚Äì which incidentally was discussed recently by a major contemporary classical music divulgator, Samuel Andreyev, despite being a relatively ""simple"" and accessible work ‚Äì Rafael Toral's 'Spectral Evolution'.  
  
Music doesn't need to be complex to be moving, in the broad sense; and it doesn't need to be complex to be art. A lot of currently recognized as artistic works are rather structurally simple, and this is true for classical music as it is for pop, rock, or noise music. So: game music is art, in it's own way; go, listen to it, celebrate it, be proud of it! And never feel timid about wanting to simply enjoy life as much as possible. You are human, and all we want is to express ourselves and experience the world intensely, with no regrets, with all our souls.  
  
On a different tangent, as this is a sort of continuation to the previous post I mentioned, videogame music is not ""classical music""; but it doesn't need to be in order to be considered first of all as legitimate, and then, again, as art.  
  
It's not classical music because it's not part of that direct lineage of traditions from which the great Western European composers of the past were part of. This, of course, has nothing to do with a lot of it's most popular works being Japanese. We already have a lot of globally recognized japanese and oversea classical music, in the form of Yoshimatsu, Takemitsu, Unsuk Chin, Wang Xilin, Tan Dun, etc, to limit myself to Asia and name just a few. Those composers, compared to videogame music ones, are directly inspired and completely aware of their influences rooted in the same ""music theory"" tradition that influenced the great classical composers of the past. What they write might be very different, but their background finds it's origin in those same traditions and, overtime, has reacted to it in completely deliberate ways, which is different from the passive approach of soundtrack writing, where some aesthetic and functional aspects of it are used simply because of the necessities of the market.  
  
The composer has little say in personal expression in these works, which is instead another focal point of traditional classical music writing. I expanded on this and other points in another comment I wrote previously, but I will be happy to reiterate them if enough people are curious about it. This post, however, is not about the case of videogame music being or not classical music specifically. My point is: videogame soundtracks are not ""classical music"", but that doesn't make them any less deserving to be featured in concert halls and so be able to touch the heartstrings of players and enthusiasts alike in novel and reinvigorating ways. If anything, I expect them to! I welcome it. In the meanwhile, they can indeed also act as ""genre gateways"" of sorts.  
  
I will repeat the note of my last post: I am not an elitist. I made sure to spell it out very clearly back there, but it seems some people of relevance still misinterpreted it, which, honestly, might still be on me, as I don't actually plan or think my posts through. They really are just mere flows of thoughts.

I can't think of any other big critic toward videogame music right now, but if you have any in mind let me know. I am sure there are valid and ultimately personal ones, but as far as the ones I brought up are concerned I don't feel they are that stable. Of course, fellow vgm listeners are completely aware of the value of the music from the industry already; they don't need to be reassured of it most of the time. This is for those who are somewhat uncertain about where they stand with their opinions on the specific topics I brought up I guess.

I will make sure to edit the post if any interesting additional inputs are shared.",Music

**Favorites**

1. **Cyndi Lauper**

Literally nobody had more enthusiasm in this than Cyndi Lauper. From her ""whoa whoa WHOA"" buildup, to when she starts singing in the background over other singers, she's absolutely entertaining the entire time.

2) **Stevie Wonder**

I know he's blind so his dancing was partially so enthusiastic because he never saw anyone else dance, but I love every moment he's in this. Stevie Wonder, in this like the rest of his music, was feeling the groove, and I love it.

3) **Daryl Hall**

He had like 5 seconds of screen time, and in that time he hit like 15 different totally correct notes, all with this absolutely fantastic vibrato. No notes Daryl. No notes at all.

**Least Favorites**

1) **Michael Jackson**

I think in a song dedicated to helping the less fortunate, it was sort of tasteless for MJ to show up with a diamond studded glove and gold lined parade outfit while literally everyone else was dressed fairly modestly. I get that he helped write the song, but like... so did Lionel Richie and Lionel didn't take the opportunity to get a camera zoom in of his entire outfit. He even put on shades in the second full scene he gave himself.

There's a crowd scene later where everyone else is singing the chorus and Michael Jackson (who had another costume change) looks behind him while everyone is singing, mouths something like ""bwa bwo"", then turns around and doesn't sing.

2) **Billy Joel**

I don't know that this really highlighted Billy Joel very well, which is fair, there are a lot of people, but I think Billy Joel is at his strongest when there's a piano in front of him, and this didn't really give him a chance to show off.

3) **Bob Dylan**

Again, I get that his style is to not sing, but he sounds like he's meant to be giving a speech in the intermission, or like... he's reading the words for the first time at a funeral he's really upset about.

I don't know if he's the voice I'd end the group chorus on.",Music

bb640opi,1cb1mrb,1713869862.0,Squier Modding or Buying A New Guitar,"I am a self produced artist and I also mix and engineer for myself and I like playing with my instruments too but I‚Äôm also tryna find a unique sound to my music but also not spend crazy amounts of money unless it‚Äôs necessary.

I‚Äôm tryna find a way to find my sound and I‚Äôm thinking of modding my one and only electric guitar that I have rn and which it‚Äôs also my first guitar that I‚Äôve been using for like three years which is a Squier

But I don‚Äôt know if I should mod it or buy a new guitar with an already set and distinct sound to itself.

If I was to buy a new guitar it would be between an Epiphone Firebird, A Fender Stratocaster, or a Jagstang. (Assume that I would buy most of these used)

If I was too mod my Squier I would change the tuners to some gotoh tuners, a gotoh 510 bridge or vegatram (both are floating bridges), change the chrome and silver parts to gold. The pickups would go something like this, a Les Paul humbucker at the neck pickup, a reverse lipstick tele pickup in the middle, and a mini humbucker on the bridge pickup. If I have to settle between having a humbucker on both neck and bridge or mini humbucker in neck and bridge I would choose the mini humbucker if I can‚Äôt have both separate pickups. The pickups would be gold.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out which would be worth the money and time, but im also tryna have some flair n style n uniqueness to my sound to my production in music and I don‚Äôt know if changing the parts would do me any good and save me some time to buying and going through new guitars or if I should just switch guitars and just have 2 guitars on standby whenever I want to change between smooth or rocky.

The options are modding my squier or buying a new one please give me some recommendations on what I could do to find a unique sound.

And give me some recommendations on parts if your for the modding.",Music

Hey group.

Hoping for help from someone with a wider knowledge of the genre.

About a month ago, a song played on my phone that I meant to get the name of for future listening.  I stupidly thought I'd remember to look at the song info when I got out of the car but alas!

I've been hearing the song in my head without knowing enough of it to search it on Google with any accuracy.

The song is by a female artist, most likely Irish.

Subject of the song is a marriage which is strained because the husband is in love with a man but is trying to either hide it or not admit it.

The wife isn't mad, more sad that he couldn't love her the same way.

A part of the lyrics mention that he talks about this guy when he's sleeping.  Another part I think mentions that she just wants him to.look at her the way he looks at this other man.

I know it's not much to work with.  Anyone who might have an idea please comment.

Thanks to all in advance.",Music
r2r7v74t,1cb004l,1713863426.0,The Commercialization of Indie Music: Evolution or Degradation?,"I've been pondering something lately and wanted to throw it out there for discussion: the commercialization of indie music. It's like, on one hand, it's great to see indie artists getting recognition and making some cash doing what they love. But then, there's this nagging feeling that maybe something pure is being lost in the process, you know?

I mean, when a band goes from playing tiny clubs to headlining huge festivals sponsored by big corporations, it's hard not to wonder if their message gets diluted along the way. Are they still singing from the heart, or just trying to please the masses and line their pockets?

Then there's the whole issue of authenticity. Can a band maintain their indie cred once they start partnering with major labels and appearing in flashy ads? Or does it all become just another product to be sold?

I'm not saying there's a right or wrong answer here, but I'm curious what y'all think. Has the commercialization of indie music brought about positive change, or are we witnessing its slow degradation? ",Music

It‚Äôs crazy, right? You can go pretty much anywhere and hear some form of it blasting from speakers. But here‚Äôs the thing: is it a cool cultural exchange or is it more like musical dominance? 

I mean, sure, it‚Äôs awesome that different cultures are vibing with Western tunes and putting their own spin on things. But at the same time, is it kinda overshadowing their own traditional music? Like, are we inadvertently wiping out local music scenes?

I‚Äôve seen some heated debates about this online. Some peeps argue that it‚Äôs all about sharing and celebrating diversity. Others think it‚Äôs more about big music corporations pushing their stuff everywhere.

What do you all reckon? Is Western music enriching other cultures or is it just taking over? And how do we strike a balance between appreciating global tunes and preserving local musical traditions?",Music

Music isn't just about hitting the right notes; it's about creativity, expression, and connecting with others. Plus, studies show it boosts brainpower and academic performance. So why isn't it a must-have in every curriculum?  
  
Sure, not everyone will become the next Mozart, but that's not the point. It's about fostering a deeper appreciation for the arts and giving students a well-rounded education. Plus, it's a chance for kids to discover hidden talents they never knew they had.  
  
But hey, I get it. Schools have limited time and resources, and there's already a laundry list of ""essential"" subjects. But is music really any less important than math or science?

Take the recent debates over certain rap songs or heavy metal tracks. Some people argue they promote violence or misogyny, while others say they're just reflecting reality. Personally, I think it's a bit of both. Music can definitely influence our thoughts and behavior, but it's also a reflection of society's issues.  
  
But where do we draw the line? Should there be some sort of censorship, or should we let artists say whatever they want, consequences be damned? And who decides what's okay and what's not? It's a tricky debate, and I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on it.",Music

The arrogant douchey frat boy persona, Woodstock 99 (which I think he gets unfair blame for), the ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù music, etc. Now I am only 23, so Chocolate Starfish came out the week after I was born. I wasn‚Äôt around to witness the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù of LB, however their music isn‚Äôt really as bad as I‚Äôve heard people say. Ofc they have their stereotypical frat douche songs like Rollin‚Äô, Break Stuff, Nookie. But they have so many other songs than that, and some of them are actually quite good. Again this is all my personal opinion and music taste, but some of their more ‚Äúemotional‚Äù songs are actually quite enjoyable/ vulnerable. Not to mention Fred actually has a really nice singing voice. For a couple examples of personal favorites The One, Re-Arranged, Boiler, and I especially like the cover of Behind Blue Eyes they did. These aren‚Äôt the songs people usually picture when they hear Limp Bizkit, but they are just as important as any other song. I think a lot of the good parts of their catalogue get skimmed over for the tracks that are the basic, everybody knows songs. A lot of these songs show a very vulnerable and upset Fred Durst. All he did was express how he truly felt, which is what art is all about. Idk maybe it‚Äôs just me ,but I think LB and Fred deserve more respect than they get. I think anyone who hates them based on the basic songs, and media perception of the band should genuinely take a listen to more of their songs/ songs mentioned. It might change your mind, and open it to some decent music from a band you never thought you‚Äôd like. Like I said I wasn‚Äôt alive for most of the peak so maybe I‚Äôm just ignorant.

xcwx1nm0b,1cd3hlx,1714080829.0,An unfamiliar experience,"(Not white sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways)

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

Thank you if you respond <3

tsbrejk,1ccpg9r,1714044193.0,"Teens up-to GenZ: How do you view Hard Rock, Metal, Punk?","TLDR: It seems like the concept of ""heavy rock"" has receded to the background as only independent/niche music, where ""younger"" ppl now view it as ""older"" person music; whereas into the late '90s - '00s it was the forefront of alt/counter-culture; a completely young person thing to be into. Clearly the audio pendulum has swung to more gentle sounds, but therefore: HOW do younger ppl view the last generation of heavy rock?

I was born in '87, so by the late '90s when I was starting to get into new music on my own, all ""hard rock"" was viewed as being on a constant incline in heaviness and aggressiveness, in a way that seemed to completely refute the older person, mainstream, especially boomer, culture.

See, even though Gen X had grunge, and boomers had 70s and 80s classic rock of their own, that had started to seem tame and calm by comparison.

NEW rock felt like it was getting heavier every year: think ""nu metal"" (Linkin Park, System of a Down, Rage Against thr Machine), and ""Punk/Emo"" (Coheed & Cambria, My Chemical Romance).

In fact, the heaviness and loudness felt like part of a perpetual cultural phenomenon where it was refuting the older gen's rock for an even more aggressive rock.

It felt like an INEXORABLE, INEVITABLE INCLINE in heaviness/loudness/aggressiveness, specifically as a means to say ""fk you older, lamer, less progressive people.""

BUT NOW, in 2024, I realize I haven't seen a hugely popular rock band in... A decade? I only see them at my local dive music venues, and... People over 30.

So clearly, the pendulum has swung culturally. I suppose it was inevitable, since you can only get SO loud before you have to get quieter.

But how do younger people view it? Is it lame? Is it ""just older person"" music? Or, is it ""iconic?"" Is it ""truly classic?""

btw42r84,1ccm38i,1714030776.0,Love songs that rock,"Rock can have different meanings.  As long as it's not too tender or soft.  For example, ""Unchained Melody"" is a great love song, but it certainly does not rock.  ""How Deep is Your Love"" is dope, but it doesn't really rock.  ""More Than Words"" is great, but still, not the kind of song I'm looking for.  ""Can't Buy Me Love"" does it rock?  Technically maybe, but not quite heavy enough.  ""Skinny Love"" by Bon Iver .... not quite heavy enough.  ""True Love Will Find You in the End"" by Daniel Johnston ... not quite heavy enough.  And so on.

Hopefully no low effort. Don't just list a love song that rocks, just because it exists.  List it if it means something to you.

7l62ywd3l,1cclxsx,1714030151.0,Figuring out the Taylor hate.,"My two cents on the hate..

The thing with swift is this. Her music is successful because of the relatitibility of the emotions found in the lyrics. Its written for feelings that a lot of people have. And the words themselves mostly say exactly what they mean.

This also means that if you cant connect with her lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to latch onto. Its about the words. The music is a vessel for her words.

Music like Under Pressure (just the first thing i thought of) often resonates more through the sound of its musical elements like the bassline and the drums rather than the actual meaning of the lyrics. 
The lyrics could have been anything as long as they sound nice. They serve a different function.
Nobody is singing along to under pressure because they relate to the lyrics lol. 

These 2 types of music each offers a different avenue for connection. 

People who like option 2 tend to hate on option 1 because to them it sounds extremely shallow.
And it their worldview that makes perfect sense.
Like I said. Her songs are about the lyrics. So if you dont connect with the lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to them.

vq7m0s3w,1ccj7lp,1714019916.0,What are your thoughts on the Australian rock band Mondo Rock?,"From Wikipedia:

>**Mondo Rock** are an Australian rock band, formed in November 1976 in Melbourne, Victoria. Singer-songwriter Ross Wilson founded the band, following the split of his previous band Daddy Cool. Guitarist Eric McCusker, who joined in 1980, wrote many of the band's hits, and along with Wilson formed the core of the group. They are best known for their second album, *Chemistry*, which was released in July 1981 and peaked at number 2 on the Australian Kent Music Report. Their song ""Come Said the Boy"" peaked at number 2 in Australia in 1983.

>Mondo Rock disbanded in 1991, although they periodically appeared at reunion concerts, and reformed on a more-or-less continuing basis in 2014. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, ""by way of ceaseless touring and the release of a series of sophisticated pop rock albums, \[the band was\] one of the most popular acts in Australia during the early 1980s"". The band had a national tour in 2019, and continues to play occasional dates.

I cannot say I am huge fan but one song of theirs I love to the core is ""State of the Heart"". The feeling of romantic longing and melancholia it evokes is unbeatable. Following lyrics cut straight to my heart, every time I listen to it:

*You are the moon, I am the sea*  
*You pull me in and gaze on down at me*

It has got a fantastic outro as well, with Ross Wilson sort-of howling like a wolf at the moon.

tngnn8vgx,1ccbvdl,1713998353.0,Why I listen bad distortion and artificial sound in many remasters or newer songs after 2017-2018 that they have much loudness?,"Hello, I have this problem. Even if I have checked in a doctor last year, I have no problem of hearing. Then, I have tried many different sets of headphones, but cheap, around 30 euros (like 30 dollars) in different laptops, pcs etc. Yes, 30 euros are very cheap, but also I have tried 2-3 times with headphones of 100 euros of friends and the same problem.

With the older songs I have no problem. But in new songs like Taylor Swift Evermore, Folkrore, Midnights etc it sounds me very strange or in Billie Eilish songs, I can't listen high frequencies and sound is artificial.

Same when I listened these on vinyl without headphones of course from a Technics Turntable in the home of one friend of mine. Same with new remastered vinyls from older Greek classics (I am from Greece), that these re-releases have very loudness, distortion, hard bass and subbass and fake digitized sound. Same with re-releases for first time on vinyl, from late 90s (that never before had released on vinyl). Original vinyls editions from old classics and compact discs released in 90s (from 70s, 80s classics) are so perfect with crystal clear sound, and the majority of Greek and International Music since about 2015.

Finally, I realized that spotify has awful sound and distortion in newer songs!IThey sound overcompressed.I don't understand why and that's the reason I stopped my premium subscription.

dzi29,1cbwige,1713960540.0,Let's talk 'inaccessible' music,"EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I'm not interested in having a slapfight about what albums are hard and what aren't. I'm interested in how people percieve those things. We all know that Disco Volante and Filth and Sing To God and Pulse Demon are difficult listens for a lot of people. 

Discussions about musical inaccessibility often tumble into strange squabbles about who has the most extreme taste, with people touting their own favourites as the really hard stuff and putting others' picks down. Someone calls Kid A a hard album, then someone else tells them that that album is for babies and Trout Mask Replica is a truly difficult experience. A third person enters the conversation and tells the others off, saying that Soundtracks for the Blind is actually hard. And it goes on and on until eventually, someone mentions Merzbow, and that usually shuts the discussion down. 

I don't want that, since one of the more interesting things about this topic is how relative it is. For me, someone who's grown up with free jazz and experimental but listened to very little electronic music, Kid A was initially way harder to listen to than Trout Mask Replica ever was. So let's try to keep a relativistic view on this. 

So, how do you feel about musical difficulty? What difficult albums did you find easy, and what easy albums did you find difficult? And is there even value to calling albums difficult in the first place? What do you think?",Music
1d2xslo,1cbwdcn,1713960094.0,"Being too undiscriminating when it comes to discovery of new music. Where do you draw the lines between forgettable, alright and good?","I have a system of discovering new music. I'm not going to describe it here, but the idea is to force myself out of my comfort zone and listen to music I would normally not listen to. Obviously, I have no problems telling if I really love or hate an album, but the problem is with the stuff somewhere in the middle. Most of the music that ends up on my list is not *bad*. The musicians are competent and there's almost always at least something to like about the albums.

Yesterday, somehow, Cher Lloyd came up in my queue. I'm pretty much the exact opposite of the target audience and I knew the songs wouldn't end up in my playlists, but I would have a hard time calling her a bad artist. It's not for me, but it's alright. On the other side of the spectrum I have artists like Thom Yorke, whose music I can kinda vibe with, but I don't listen to him, because I really don't like his whiny voice.

So the issue is that I find a lot of music ""alright"", but I don't have strong feelings about it. Which becomes a problem when I'm looking for new areas of music to explore. I don't want to waste too much time listening to mediocre music, but I also know that some music I had to push myself to listen to before I started liking it and actively looking for it.

So where do you personally draw the line between what's good and what you know to leave alone?

Alright, so I just finished binge-listening to a bunch of classical operas, and let me tell you, the narrative techniques embedded in the music blew my mind! Like, seriously, I never realized how much storytelling power music holds until now.  
  
Think about it: the way composers use leitmotifs to represent characters or themes throughout the opera is like creating a musical roadmap of the story. It's insane how a simple melody can evoke so much emotion and anticipation.  
  
And don't even get me started on the orchestration! The way different instruments are used to mirror the actions or emotions of the characters adds a whole new layer of depth to the narrative. It's like the music is speaking a language of its own, weaving together the plot in a way that words alone couldn't capture.

r45rhhap,1cbuzb8,1713955347.0,Historical Context of Classical Music and Its Connection to Social Movements Explored.,"Growing up, I used to think classical music was just for fancy occasions or background noise in period dramas. But recently, I stumbled upon a podcast that blew my mind about the historical context of classical music and its ties to social movements. It's crazy how much depth and meaning these seemingly old tunes carry!  
  
The podcast dove into how composers like Beethoven and Mozart weren't just musical geniuses, but also deeply affected by the social and political landscapes of their time. From revolutions to societal upheavals, their compositions often reflected the pulse of the era.  
  
One thing that struck me was how certain pieces were subtly rebellious or even revolutionary in nature, challenging the status quo through music. It made me appreciate classical music in a whole new light ‚Äì it's not just about fancy symphonies, but a reflection of human struggle and triumph.  
  
Have any of you delved into the historical context of classical music? What blew your mind the most?",Music
r45xpty4,1cbutpg,1713954735.0,Musical Devices Depicting Nature in Classical Orchestral Works Analyzed.,"Guys, you know when you're listening to classical music and suddenly you're like, ""Wait, is that a bird chirping?"" Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I've been diving into some of the most famous orchestral pieces lately, and I've noticed something super cool: composers are low-key obsessed with nature sounds.  
  
Take Beethoven's ""Pastoral Symphony,"" for example. Dude practically paints a whole forest with those flutes and clarinets. And don't even get me started on Vivaldi's ""The Four Seasons."" Each movement feels like you're right there in spring, summer, fall, and winter.  
  
But it's not just about birds and rustling leaves. Some composers get pretty creative. Have you heard of Ottorino Respighi's ""Pines of Rome""? Bro, he legit incorporates a recording of a nightingale singing! Talk about next-level immersion.  
  
Anyway, I'm kinda geeking out over here, but I wanna know: What's your favorite classical piece that makes you feel like you're chilling in nature? Let's swap recommendations and vibe together.

I've always been a huge fan of classical music, and Beethoven's work has a special place in my heart.  
  
So, here's the deal: I stumbled upon this study that delves into how the tempo of a piece affects how expressive we think it is. Like, imagine listening to the same symphony, but one version is played a bit faster than the other. Would you feel the same emotions from both?   
  
Turns out, researchers found some fascinating results. They played different recordings of Beethoven's symphonies to participants at varying tempos and asked them to rate the expressiveness. And guess what? The tempo had a significant impact on how people perceived the music! It's wild how something as subtle as speed can change our emotional response.

5b7qgw1u,1cbtq2m,1713950172.0,The Downward Spiral (1994)... wow.,"I'll admit it right away - I'm not someone who listens to full albums. I'm more of a singles guy.

There is, quite literally, only a handful of albums that I've actually listened to in their entirety.

As of yesterday evening, the newest addition to that handful is Nine Inch Nails' *The Downward Spiral.*

I had read stuff about how it tells a story of a man who feels broken and helpless all the time and all that, and eventually unalives himself.

Supposedly, that album was also one of the inspirations for Chuck Palahniuk to write *Fight Club.*

So, I was convinced.

Had it been some previous time in my life that I first listened to this, I would've probably considered it mid, with quite a lot of songs being fillers, especially ""Mr. Self Destruct"", ""Heresy"", and ""I Do Not Want This"".

But now, that I've been through some tough shit in my life, I completely understand it.

Trent Reznor had to let all his inner demons out. He just had to.

It's one thing to seemingly be aware of all the raging, unpleasant, horrifying thoughts that reside in another human being's head.

It's something entirely else to see it for yourself what those thoughts actually are.

Lastly, the closing track is ""Hurt"".

A lot of things about this track has already been said. Namely, without that track, this album would feel like just another industrial rock album, and just another album in general.

And of course, that song probably means a lot to some people personally. Yes, that version, not Johnny Cash's version.

But there is another track that helps to have this album removed from being just another typical depressing, helpless album.

That track is ""A Warm Place"". In the context of the whole album, its interpretation might be that of some false hope, inside the guy's mind.

It's not until that false hope proves to be just that - a false hope - that the ground is set for events that lead to ""Hurt"".

All in all, an incredible album. One that, if you've been through some really tough shit in your life, you'll find *very* relatable.",Music

I am looking for people to text with either on telegram or discord to share with music that we like in common. However, I don't (really) listen to mainstream music or popular rock covers, they just do not click with me.

I really prefer the deep archive, catchy stuff from bygone eras - in particular, jazz and rock from the 50's, 60's & 70's. The stuff I listen to is often singles and knockoff covers by no-name bands and studio artists that failed to make any impact and hit the charts, and typically only have a couple thousand (or hundred) views on YouTube, if any. 

Some of these artists I like include Jim Oertling, Ray Batts, The P.K. Limited, The Aquarian Age, and many others.

I also enjoy bluegrass and old-style country, including sub-genres like honky-tonk, hillbilly and (notably) ragtime jazz such as Joe ""Fingers"" Carr.

xcwx1nm0b,1cd3hlx,1714080829.0,An unfamiliar experience,"(Not white sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways)

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

Thank you if you respond <3

Anita Baker, Bonnie Raitt, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Bob Seger, Mariah Carey, The Bee Gees, Smokey Robinson, John Fogerty, Bono, Greg Allman, Joni Mitchell, Steven Tyler, Janis Joplin, George Jones, Gladys Knight, Bob Dylan, Beyonc√©, Christina Aguilera, Tom Waits, George Strait, Marvin Gaye, Johnny Mathis, David Ruffin, Stevie Wonder, Karen Carpenter, Jim Morrison, Celine Dion, Tina Turner, Thom Yorke, Al Green, Philip Bailey, Tammy Wynette, Stevie Nicks, Brandy, Linda Ronstadt, Nina Simone, Randy Travis, George Michael, etc. have all changed the face of music forever when it came to their own style of singing.

People started emulating them as a result while they developing their voice.

We now only have a handful of original sounding vocalists in the 21st century, Adele, Amy Winehouse, John Legend, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Hudson, Demi Lovato, Florence Welch, Carrie Underwood, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Rihanna, Lana Del Rey, Regina Spektor, Billie Eilish, Amy Lee, Jazmine Sullivan, Chris Stapleton.

Can you think of newer singers right now that will rewrite history as far as singing style is concerned?

Also, doesn't have to be a band. Could be a singer, a rapper, or whatever.

And I understand determining an official band for places like LA or California generally would probably be impossible, but surely less ""on the map"" places do. 

For example, I'm in The Granite State aka New Hampshire and we'd probably claim Aerosmith in a statewide vote, but Ronnie James Dio was born in Portsmouth, NH so I'd personally rather claim Dio.

But what a lot of people might not know is we're also the birthplace of some noteworthy punk bands like The Bruisers and The Queers, and, unfortunately depending on your perspective, GG Allin.

Perhaps our greatest claim to fame? Arguably the worst band of all-time: The Shaggs! If you don't know their ""hit"" My Pal Foot Foot, I implore you to give it a listen and understand that the deaf may be the fortunate ones.

tsbrejk,1ccpg9r,1714044193.0,"Teens up-to GenZ: How do you view Hard Rock, Metal, Punk?","TLDR: It seems like the concept of ""heavy rock"" has receded to the background as only independent/niche music, where ""younger"" ppl now view it as ""older"" person music; whereas into the late '90s - '00s it was the forefront of alt/counter-culture; a completely young person thing to be into. Clearly the audio pendulum has swung to more gentle sounds, but therefore: HOW do younger ppl view the last generation of heavy rock?

I was born in '87, so by the late '90s when I was starting to get into new music on my own, all ""hard rock"" was viewed as being on a constant incline in heaviness and aggressiveness, in a way that seemed to completely refute the older person, mainstream, especially boomer, culture.

See, even though Gen X had grunge, and boomers had 70s and 80s classic rock of their own, that had started to seem tame and calm by comparison.

NEW rock felt like it was getting heavier every year: think ""nu metal"" (Linkin Park, System of a Down, Rage Against thr Machine), and ""Punk/Emo"" (Coheed & Cambria, My Chemical Romance).

In fact, the heaviness and loudness felt like part of a perpetual cultural phenomenon where it was refuting the older gen's rock for an even more aggressive rock.

It felt like an INEXORABLE, INEVITABLE INCLINE in heaviness/loudness/aggressiveness, specifically as a means to say ""fk you older, lamer, less progressive people.""

BUT NOW, in 2024, I realize I haven't seen a hugely popular rock band in... A decade? I only see them at my local dive music venues, and... People over 30.

So clearly, the pendulum has swung culturally. I suppose it was inevitable, since you can only get SO loud before you have to get quieter.

But how do younger people view it? Is it lame? Is it ""just older person"" music? Or, is it ""iconic?"" Is it ""truly classic?""

7l62ywd3l,1cclxsx,1714030151.0,Figuring out the Taylor hate.,"My two cents on the hate..

The thing with swift is this. Her music is successful because of the relatitibility of the emotions found in the lyrics. Its written for feelings that a lot of people have. And the words themselves mostly say exactly what they mean.

This also means that if you cant connect with her lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to latch onto. Its about the words. The music is a vessel for her words.

Music like Under Pressure (just the first thing i thought of) often resonates more through the sound of its musical elements like the bassline and the drums rather than the actual meaning of the lyrics. 
The lyrics could have been anything as long as they sound nice. They serve a different function.
Nobody is singing along to under pressure because they relate to the lyrics lol. 

These 2 types of music each offers a different avenue for connection. 

People who like option 2 tend to hate on option 1 because to them it sounds extremely shallow.
And it their worldview that makes perfect sense.
Like I said. Her songs are about the lyrics. So if you dont connect with the lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to them.

Let‚Äôs talk record labels. As an indie artist, I always wondered what the deal was with these labels ‚Äì are they really as crucial as they seem? Turns out, yeah, they kinda are.   
  
I dove deep into researching how record labels operate, and it‚Äôs fascinating stuff. They‚Äôre not just about signing contracts and cashing in on your hits. Nope, they‚Äôre the backbone of the industry, handling everything from production to distribution and promotion. And yeah, they take a cut, but it‚Äôs often worth it for the resources they bring to the table.  
  
But here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äì not all labels are created equal. Some are major players with huge budgets and connections, while others focus on niche genres or emerging artists. And then there are indie labels, offering more creative freedom but fewer resources.  
  
So, fellow music lovers, what‚Äôs your take on record labels? Are they essential for success, or can artists thrive without them?",Music

vq7m0s3w,1ccj7lp,1714019916.0,What are your thoughts on the Australian rock band Mondo Rock?,"From Wikipedia:

>**Mondo Rock** are an Australian rock band, formed in November 1976 in Melbourne, Victoria. Singer-songwriter Ross Wilson founded the band, following the split of his previous band Daddy Cool. Guitarist Eric McCusker, who joined in 1980, wrote many of the band's hits, and along with Wilson formed the core of the group. They are best known for their second album, *Chemistry*, which was released in July 1981 and peaked at number 2 on the Australian Kent Music Report. Their song ""Come Said the Boy"" peaked at number 2 in Australia in 1983.

>Mondo Rock disbanded in 1991, although they periodically appeared at reunion concerts, and reformed on a more-or-less continuing basis in 2014. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, ""by way of ceaseless touring and the release of a series of sophisticated pop rock albums, \[the band was\] one of the most popular acts in Australia during the early 1980s"". The band had a national tour in 2019, and continues to play occasional dates.

I cannot say I am huge fan but one song of theirs I love to the core is ""State of the Heart"". The feeling of romantic longing and melancholia it evokes is unbeatable. Following lyrics cut straight to my heart, every time I listen to it:

*You are the moon, I am the sea*  
*You pull me in and gaze on down at me*

It has got a fantastic outro as well, with Ross Wilson sort-of howling like a wolf at the moon.

You ever just stare at an album cover and feel the sheer power pulsating from it? Or witness a stage performance that sends shivers down your spine with its electrifying visuals? That's what I'm talking about!

From elaborate sets to pyrotechnics that light up the night, metal bands know how to put on a spectacle.

Take a band like Babymetal, for example. They blend metal with J-pop in a way that shouldn't work, but somehow totally does. And it's not just about the music itself. The internet has played a huge role in connecting metalheads from every corner of the globe. We're swapping music, sharing influences, and breaking down barriers like never before.  
  
But it's not all rainbows and unicorns. Globalization has also led to some heated debates about cultural appropriation and authenticity. Where do we draw the line between appreciation and appropriation? It's a tricky question, and one that doesn't have an easy answer.

Even if I have checked in a doctor last year, I have no problem of hearing. Then, I have tried many different sets of headphones, but cheap, around 30 euros (like 30 dollars) in different laptops, pcs etc. Yes, 30 euros are very cheap, but also I have tried 2-3 times with headphones of 100 euros of friends and the same problem.

With the older songs I have no problem. But in new songs like Taylor Swift Evermore, Folkrore, Midnights etc it sounds me very strange or in Billie Eilish songs, I can't listen high frequencies and sound is artificial.

Same when I listened these on vinyl without headphones of course from a Technics Turntable in the home of one friend of mine. Same with new remastered vinyls from older Greek classics (I am from Greece), that these re-releases have very loudness, distortion, hard bass and subbass and fake digitized sound. Same with re-releases for first time on vinyl, from late 90s (that never before had released on vinyl). Original vinyls editions from old classics and compact discs released in 90s (from 70s, 80s classics) are so perfect with crystal clear sound, and the majority of Greek and International Music since about 2015.

xcwx1nm0b,1cd3hlx,1714080829.0,An unfamiliar experience,"(Not white sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways)

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

Thank you if you respond <3

tsbrejk,1ccpg9r,1714044193.0,"Teens up-to GenZ: How do you view Hard Rock, Metal, Punk?","TLDR: It seems like the concept of ""heavy rock"" has receded to the background as only independent/niche music, where ""younger"" ppl now view it as ""older"" person music; whereas into the late '90s - '00s it was the forefront of alt/counter-culture; a completely young person thing to be into. Clearly the audio pendulum has swung to more gentle sounds, but therefore: HOW do younger ppl view the last generation of heavy rock?

I was born in '87, so by the late '90s when I was starting to get into new music on my own, all ""hard rock"" was viewed as being on a constant incline in heaviness and aggressiveness, in a way that seemed to completely refute the older person, mainstream, especially boomer, culture.

See, even though Gen X had grunge, and boomers had 70s and 80s classic rock of their own, that had started to seem tame and calm by comparison.

NEW rock felt like it was getting heavier every year: think ""nu metal"" (Linkin Park, System of a Down, Rage Against thr Machine), and ""Punk/Emo"" (Coheed & Cambria, My Chemical Romance).

In fact, the heaviness and loudness felt like part of a perpetual cultural phenomenon where it was refuting the older gen's rock for an even more aggressive rock.

It felt like an INEXORABLE, INEVITABLE INCLINE in heaviness/loudness/aggressiveness, specifically as a means to say ""fk you older, lamer, less progressive people.""

BUT NOW, in 2024, I realize I haven't seen a hugely popular rock band in... A decade? I only see them at my local dive music venues, and... People over 30.

So clearly, the pendulum has swung culturally. I suppose it was inevitable, since you can only get SO loud before you have to get quieter.

But how do younger people view it? Is it lame? Is it ""just older person"" music? Or, is it ""iconic?"" Is it ""truly classic?""

""More Than Words"" is great, but still, not the kind of song I'm looking for.  ""Can't Buy Me Love"" does it rock?  Technically maybe, but not quite heavy enough.

7l62ywd3l,1cclxsx,1714030151.0,Figuring out the Taylor hate.,"My two cents on the hate..

The thing with swift is this. Her music is successful because of the relatitibility of the emotions found in the lyrics. Its written for feelings that a lot of people have. And the words themselves mostly say exactly what they mean.

This also means that if you cant connect with her lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to latch onto. Its about the words. The music is a vessel for her words.

Music like Under Pressure (just the first thing i thought of) often resonates more through the sound of its musical elements like the bassline and the drums rather than the actual meaning of the lyrics. 
The lyrics could have been anything as long as they sound nice. They serve a different function.
Nobody is singing along to under pressure because they relate to the lyrics lol. 

These 2 types of music each offers a different avenue for connection. 

People who like option 2 tend to hate on option 1 because to them it sounds extremely shallow.
And it their worldview that makes perfect sense.
Like I said. Her songs are about the lyrics. So if you dont connect with the lyrics there isnt a whole lot left to them.

xcwx1nm0b,1cd3hlx,1714080829.0,An unfamiliar experience,"(Not white sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways)

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

Thank you if you respond <3

1wnq9rjh,1ccwjmn,1714062919.0,If you HAD to choose between one Production and Vocals or Lyricism?,Me personally I would choose Production and vocals over lyricism. Great lyrics with amazing production is just a nice bonus. Making MUSIC isn't just lyricism and although it's a crucial part it's still a piece of MUSIC so it still has to SOUND good sonically. If the vocals are dull and not outgoing I simply have a harder time listening to it because I love vocalist and if I'm listening to an album and the voice and production sounds the same all throughout it gets pretty boring. Whitney Houston's most known song is a cover I Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton and she elevated that song with her vocals.  ,Music

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

So what I ask all you other people in this sub is this; what exactly did I feel when I played that song, why is it that it made me feel the way I felt, and have you also felt these same feelings while playing a certain song as well?

Thank you if you respond <3

My delusional friend says they will pay me $10,000 if I find a song with a similar feeling and lyrical narrative to The Killers‚Äô ‚ÄúEnterlude and Exitlude.‚Äù They claim that ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible for there to be a song like this.‚Äù Obviously there are probably many songs like it out there, but my friend specifically wants the feeling of ‚Äúsending off someone and parting ways, but cherishing their time with you and hoping to meet them again.‚Äù I‚Äôve shown them some similar songs, but they are very nitpicky about it, saying ‚Äúno country or metal or niche genres,‚Äù or ‚Äúno sappy or cliche song,‚Äù or ‚Äúit has to have lyrics that are similar.‚Äù Honestly I think the whole idea is idiotic, but I wonder if anyone knows something????? ü§îü§îü§î

xcwx1nm0b,1cd3hlx,1714080829.0,An unfamiliar experience,"(Not white sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways)

So, I have been playing bass for about three years, and I have loved it WAY MORE than guitar, mainly because of the sound of the bass, and the fact that most of the techniques played on guitar can also be translated on bass and sound amazing, such as sweep picking or tapping. Speaking of those two techniques, for a good part of my bass journey, I have always been attracted to very complex, fast, or technical stuff, the kind of stuff that you would find in genres like prog metal/rock. However, just recently, something interesting happened.

For a few months now, I have enjoyed this band called Swans, and their bassist, Christopher Pravdica, is currently one of my favorite bassists. Now, the thing about Chris, and the rest of the band, is that although their songs are very long, they aren‚Äôt a progressive band, but rather a post-band that plays these very simplistic, but highly addictive grooves and motives, which in part can be attributed to Chris and his catchy basslines in songs such as Oxygen and Screen Shot.

One night, I wanted to play a song by the band called ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù a nineteen minute song where the bass doesn‚Äôt come in until about 9 1/2 minutes in. It starts off with this very bouncy, pedaling bass riff which is cool, but then when the song reaches the 15-minute mark, that‚Äôs where something strange happened.

As I was playing that particular bassline, I suddenly found myself doing the following: closing my eyes, swaying back and forth with rhythm, and really focusing with the song‚Äôs instrumentation. In addition, I had actually began to picture myself playing this song live in front of an audience, with a metaphorical band (the concert took place in a large log cabin for whatever reason, probably because of the song‚Äôs mood).

But basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that out of all the songs that I‚Äôve learned how to play on bass, this song, ‚ÄúA Piece Of The Sky,‚Äù was really the first song that can remember putting me into this specific, trance-like state, as if I was becoming one with the groove, does that make sense? Since then, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate this song, and the band much more than I previously had.
