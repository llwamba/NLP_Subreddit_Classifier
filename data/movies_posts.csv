w3vcatnq,1cd3kpd,1714081042.0,A Promising Young Woman (Ryan Cooper),"I just watched this movie this morning. It was interesting and I kinda liked it except one part...

The Character Ryan Cooper, what is the propuse, draw, or appeal of this character as a love interest?

1. He's ugly (like face ugly).
2. He has the personality of a fence post.
3. He comes off as dim in the film.
4. He has the social skills of a baby kangaroo.

And to top it all off he is partially responsible for her friends rape an death? And she just like yep this is the guy?

Here they are frolicking about in a strange lovebird montage? 

I just don't get how that was supposed to be a believable relationship?

In the films defense I did watch most of this on mute with subtitles on while distracted so very possible I missed something. 

Does anyone have any thoughts as to why this added to the film or did anyone have any thoughts as to why they thought this relationship was compelling?

It is a horror movie shot in Petaluma that came out in 1999. I cannot find an online source to watch it! In attempts to procure a physical copy, I visited the Petaluma Visitors Center (nice ladies, but they had not heard of it). At the visitors center we looked through a list of ""movies shot in Sonoma County"" stretching back to 1913 and Incident at Haystack Landing was not on the list. The next day, I visited the Petaluma Historical Library and Museum. The docent there had indeed heard of the movie, but they did not have a copy (she was only able to print the IMDB page off the internet for me, which was a very nice gesture). I then visited Copperfield's book store in downtown hoping they'd have a movie section, but they did not.

Some thoughts:

a. I would say it's a real come back if he made no films at all during his 'quiet' years. 

b. During his 'quiet' years did he take on these lesser roles by choice (to stay active in the industry) or not (to pay bills)?

Oh, another one I really liked was ""Hacksaw Ridge"", apparently the directors had to cut out some of the story/scenes, cause it was just ""too unbelievable"". It's normally never like that, it's always the other way around.

War dogs was also pretty great, but on a totally different level, It was dramatized as fuck obviously, but it also showed some stuff that can be verified, so it's at least based on a true story.

* The little people against the big corps or big gov that can make changes

i6bon,1ccyvps,1714070315.0,How do you rate movies?,"I've been thinking a lot recently on how I review films and why I give them the ratings I do.

This largely boils down to much weight you put towards enjoyment vs film analysis when rating a movie.

By film analysis, I refer to the standards we hold in regards to what we think a ""good"" film should contain. Not that I think film analysis is objective, but I think there are well established principles in relation to storytelling and cinema that I take seriously, and I apply them when critiquing a movie.

I think one of the most obvious examples of this dilemma is The Room. A film which I think most of us would agree fails on most levels of film analysis, but many get a tremendous amount of enjoyment from. How do you rate that?

The more I document my film scores on sites like letterboxd the more I come around to the position that the worst thing a movie can be is bland. Movies that I have rated 4 or 5 out of 10 and that I remember absolutely nothing of, with no intent to return to. There are movies I've rated far lower that were at least memorable and made me feel something.

So the movie that I always thought of this for was 1408. Samuel L. Jackson has a much more extended role than it needs to be (probably to use him more in promotion) as the manager of the hotel that has the evil room in it. Some of the marketing even kind of implied that he was the villain or evil in some way. But all he does is be really persistent in trying to convince John Cusack's character from not staying in the evil room...and he's not wrong obviously. Like the worst thing you can say about him is that his motives are a bit selfish and he's mostly concerned with the hotel's reputation, but what he wants is better for both the hotel and Cusack. And the worst thing he does is maybe try to outright bribe Cusack from staying there? But that's maybe just a little shady, but it's not even illegal in this context.

Eisenstein changed my perception of cinema. Before I saw cinema as strictly narrative, but now I realize it doesn’t have to be (though Dziga Vertov also influenced this change in mind) 

I hope this post made at least some people want to see his films. If so please don’t start with “Battleship Potemkin.” While that is his most famous film, it’s also his second worst film imo (worst one being Alexander Nevsky) This doesn’t mean its bad, Potemkin is still quite revolutionary, its just not as good as his other films. I think the best way to experience Eisenstein is to watch his films in release order. (He only has 8 films) If you dont have time then I suggest this order: 

1- Strike (1924)
2- October (1927)
3- Ivan the Terrible Part I (1944) (His best film imo)
4- Ivan the Terrible Part II (1947/1958) (It was finished after his death)
5- Que Viva Mexico (There are different versions of this film.Eisenstein shot the footage but never finished editing)
6- General Line / Old and New (1929)
7- Battleship Potemkin (1925)
8- Alexander Nevsky (1938) 

Again all of his films are amazing, so Nevsky is only bad in relation to others.

I mean, we all have those flicks that everyone raves about, but when you finally watch them, you're like, ""What was the hype all about?"" Maybe it's a blockbuster that fell flat for you, or a critically acclaimed drama that left you yawning. Personally, I gotta say, I just don't get the fuss about \[insert movie title here\]. I know, I know, it's sacrilege to some, but it just didn't do it for me. But hey, I'm open to hearing different opinions! So, hit me up with your thoughts.

It’s a great dark thriller and a favorite of mine that I think gives real insight to Hollywood. Which I feel would be a great note to end the club. But I want another film to go along with that. Maybe a movie from Robert Altman’s filmography that has a similar vibe? Or another film that’s also about Hollywood and that shows how movies get made? Any suggestions would be great! ,movies
lpt08k9t,1cck8c7,1714023554.0,weird casting choices,"Recently watching (the admittedly terrible but comfort movie) Just Go With It and questioning why Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews both agreed to, and were cast in this movie. 

I rarely see Dave Matthews act, this especially seemed a strange role for him. Nicole Kidman, while maybe not at the peak of her career in 2011, would still seem like a very odd and far too famous person in this kind of role.

Does anyone have any idea why? What are some other strange casting choices in movies that make you say “but why???”",movies
vr1ei4,1ccjm1t,1714021326.0,What are your thoughts on animation in the West?,"TLDR: 

What have been your experiences in discussions of Animation with others? 

Do you think it is taken seriously in the West? if not, why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Whenever it comes to the discussion of animation, I am noticing very different attitude between people in the West in comparison to the East. This difference also seems more pronounced when looking at America.

The idea being that Animation, especially films, are for children. I don’t see it taken very seriously as a medium for storytelling

On the other end of the spectrum of *“Only for kids”*, there seems to be the attitude that any animation for adults should be black comedy. Popular examples such as; Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Rick and Morty, etc.

But Within the past few years there has been a boom in popular animated series aimed more towards adults which handle more emotionally mature topics and treat the storylines with sincerity rather than having a focus on dark humor; Castlevania, Primal, Cyberpunk, Arcane, Primal, Invincible, Blue Eye Samurai, Hazbin Hotel, Vox Machina, etc. 

Yet, despite the massive success of these series, in recent discussions I have had with others - I still see people who either don’t have any respect for animation as a storytelling medium or just don’t see the possibility of it being more successful if given the chance.

Disney has been remaking all of their classic animated films into live action, and although there are some voices who ask “why?” The films are still box office successes for the most part, or they would not keep making them. However people still ask “Why make live action versions of films that were already great?”

Netflix has recently been remaking popular animated works such as the previously mentioned Cowboy Bebop, One Piece, and Avatar the Last Airbender. All of which triggered various discussions about the artistic value of recreating something into live action when it was already good. 

It just seems like there is this dislike towards animation both in the industry and from audiences. Meanwhile Japan released 76 animated films for Theaters in 2022 alone.

**But I am curious about what has been your experience in discussing Animation with other people and what your thoughts are about attitudes towards animation in the West compared to the East.**",movies

I tried telling my dad to watch it before and he said he couldn’t get into. My mom watched it with me and all she gained from it was “are you trying to tell me something about our relationship?”.

This movie really helped me feel emotions I had buried deep within. It helped me gain my confidence in myself back. It helped me start to care about my life more and do the work it takes to love myself and care for myself. I realized things you choose in life doesn’t matter (they do, but you can’t change the past) because the best outcome will always find a way to come into fruition. You have to be happy with what you’ve got in the moment, and live for yourself. Don’t rely on others to fulfill what’s missing. Work on yourself and the love / happiness will find you again. This movie made me bawl my eyes out and help heal my inner child.

wvlq77gvg,1cchr2a,1714015100.0,Is Ti West's Pearl based off Scarlett O'hara from Gone With The Wind?,"I'm in the middle of watching Gone With The Wind with my grandma, and I noticed Scarlett's character reminds me a LOT of Pearl in regards to her selfish attitude and yearning for the things she can't have. Now I'm only halfway through the movie (it's like four hours holy shit) and I know Ti West said he drew influence from GWTW's glorification of ""The Lost Cause"" and of southern slavery, mirroring it with Pearl's glorification of Hollywood and all its exploitation. 

But I wonder if Pearl was based off Scarlett herself. What do you think? 

Edit: I'm not sure why I'm getting downvoted on this post 😭 I can acknowledge that Pearl is obviously her own character and the movie mirrors the Wizard of Oz more than anything. I just found the petulant nature of her to look really similar to Scarlett, is all. I am aware that we can't tell for sure what Ti West was thinking when filming Pearl, but I was just curious to see if anyone else thought of Scarlett as well. 

And I finished the film!! It was crazy!!! I can appreciate how innovative it was in 1939, even if its message is very flawed and its portrayal of life is a white-washed glorification of a really terrible time in American history. Overall I'm glad I watched it, and appreciate the technicolor, acting, and cinematography, but I don't endorse the messages in the film and I don't think it aged well in that sense.",movies
xt0g45c17,1ccgnwp,1714011788.0,Barbie Monologue vs Monster Monologue ,"I recently watched the Barbie movie and then saw I rewatched Patty Jenkin’s Monster. 

I just feel like the movie Monster does a better job of depicting ills of modern society— poverty, abuse, misogyny, America’s invisible poor, mental illness facing women than the Barbie movie. It has more to say and is goddamn fantastic filmmaking. 

I know it’s apples and oranges to compare the two movies. Yes, the Barbie movie is for families and is Feminism-lite and is a toy movie, but let’s have some fun!

Aileen : SAYS WHO? I'm good with the Lord. I'm fine with him. And I know how you were raised, alright? And I know how people fuckin' think out there, and fuck, it's gotta be that way. They've gotta tell you that 'Thou shall not kill' shit and all of that. But that's not the way the world works, Selby. Cuz I'm out there every fuckin' day living it. Who the fuck knows what God wants? People kill each other every day and for what? Hm? For politics, for religion, and THEY'RE HEROES! No, no... there's a lot of shit I can't do anymore, but killing's not one of them. And letting those fucking bastards go out and rape someone else isn't either!

Gloria: Is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.

You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood.

But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.

I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know.

qbfandkj0,1ccgk94,1714011498.0,Most Violent/Gory Movies,"What would be the most violent, gory and bloody movies you've ever seen? They can be of any genre, and this would of course be counting the completely uncut, uncensored and unedited versions of any films that have such versions. I won't be counting war films as I feel it's not fair to compare fictional staged violence to something re-creating real-life events.

I think the all-time most violent, gory and bloody movies I've seen would be in no particular order:

* Dead-Alive (AKA BrainDead)
* Day Of The Dead (1985)
* Hardcore Henry
* Natural Born Killers
* Ichi The Killer
* Re-Animator
* The Thing (John Carpenter's 1982 remake)
* The Evil Dead (both the original and 2013 remake)
* Terrifier 2 (honorable mention to the original Terrifier)
* Hellbound: Hellraiser II (honorable mention to the original as well)
* Maniac (1980)
* The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning
* Demons (1985)
* ChromeSkull: Laid To Rest 2
* Autopsy (2008)
* Versus (2000)
* Riki-Oh: The Story Of Ricky

Terrifier 2 is easily one of the most brutally violent, blood-soaked movies to come out in years. I can't say I'm surprised some moviegoers fainted in theaters. There's one particular kill scene in it (won't spoil it but if you've seen the film I'm sure you know which I'm referring to, happening to a particular character at her home) that in just that one scene alone had enough graphic gore and bloodletting for a dozen other films.

Event Horizon came close to making this list as well and if we ever get the original uncut version (which reportedly had a whopping 17 minutes of extra-gory footage excised to avoid an NC-17 rating), I bet it would. Pretty astounding to think 17 whole minutes had to be cut to avoid an NC-17 rating.",movies
sxlv38sl,1ccgh4k,1714011237.0,Movies with a true antihero?,"Not sure why this occurred to me today. Something got me to thinking about movies that might have a true antihero. Maybe my definition is too tight—this is a character that is truly a bad guy. Most movies (and tv shows) really dance around this, generally showing the character with positive traits that make him redeemable, or having him turn around during the course of the movie. 

Dexter (this is tv not movie of course) is a great example of whitewashing the anti hero. The books explored more of the sadistic serial killer side of him. But HBO turned him into more of an almost justified vengeful superhero.

Are there any true antihero movies? Where the main character is just a bad unlikable guy, through and through, all the way to the end?

Edit: lots of great responses! Loved the post on Inglorious Basterds. These were psychopaths sent to do a “good” mission—kill Hitler and end the war. And the did it like the murderous psychopaths they were!  Are there any more like this?

56u37dg2,1ccbo9s,1713997834.0,Best acting in silence?,"A good part of acting tends to come from the voice. Being able to convey emotion, passion, brilliant writing and any number of things is helped exponentially when an actor can speak. However, some of the best acting I’ve found can come when an actor doesn’t have their voice to rely on. Conveying all that emotion and passion with just your face and body is no easy feat, but when it’s pulled off it can be utterly incredible. So what are some of the best times an actor pulled off a scene without uttering a single word?

Of the two examples I have, the first is interesting. Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit already had an incredibly difficult job, acting against something that wasn’t there. But in the scene where Judge Doom reveals what he is, there’s this one shot of Hoskins where he looks utterly terrified and traumatised seeing his brothers killer right in front of him. It’s very quick but it’s such a marvellous moment.

The other is actually from television but is no less fantastic. In the Doctor Who episode Vincent and the Doctor, Tony Curran’s wordless performance as Vincent Van Gogh when they visit the museum of his work at the end is utterly heartbreakingly beautiful. Just seeing Vincent, a man who suffered from extreme depression, self doubt and pain, see his work being not just praised but (through Bill Nighy’s monologue about the impact of his work) held in the highest possible regard, Currans portrayal is just incredible.

The daughter was murdered by unknown person? But the police thought Francis committed his own daughter murder but was released because they caught the person who actually did it. Local people went into a hunt to find the missing body. This includes Eric, the dj and spokesperson at Exotica club and Christina, the dancer. That’s where they both met and found Francis daughter deceased body. 

The wife of Francis was having an affair with his brother. The guy in the wheelchair. It was confirmed sort of when they got into a car accident. The wife got killed but his brother survived resulting him to be in a wheelchair. 

Furthermore, Francis pays his brother daughter to “babysit” when in reality his daughter is not there anymore. She babysits no one. He likes the rides back with his niece because it brought him that feeling back of when he did it with Christina. 

Overall, I’m just confused

• did francis kill his daughter or not?

• why did Christina end up a dancer? 

• was Francis the biological father of his own “daughter” or  was it his brother? 

• why was the dj Eric, so obsessed with christina? 

• what’s up with the Thomas? He’s a smuggler and gay.

3ta26jz5,1ccasw2,1713995651.0,Challengers. My humble opinion.,"Are we talking about tennis? It's not just a recurring line from the movie. It's basically the whole theme of it. Cuz this movie is always about tennis. It's about tennis when they're actually playing tennis and it's about tennis when they're playing whatever the hell's going on between the three of them.

And, well, I guess you could argue winning at life could go through the same means and towards the same results of winning at tennis: dedication, passion, strength, pride, success, and, the most important one, making the right decisions. And you don't always do. That's the point. This is a drama about three people growing up and trying to achieve all of those, with variable results, of course. Is the resulting story enthralling? I happened to find it quite fascinating, yeah, but you be the judge.

It's undeniably majestically acted by all three of the au pair protagonists and it's a celebration. I mean a celebration of the obsession you could have about playing with a small yellow ball, as well as the one you could feel towards a woman's allure. It's a celebration of the jaw dropping beauty of Zendaya. it's, mostly, a celebration of the beauty of the sport, and that's particularly shown by the fact that it's not shot by playing it safe. It is, instead, a continuous exercise in trying to find the most spectacular way to portray every possible hit of the ball. It reminded me a lot of how the energy of the hits exudes so much from the pages of Happy! by Urasawa (and, now that I think of it, that story is a tennis love triangle too). Many of other shots are good too, the way they're framed is always meaningful of something. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing, albeit sometimes it may be a little overwhelming, I suppose that was deliberate.

One thing to know before you watch: please note that, to fully comprehend all the different nuances explored about the different worlds involved, you gotta look at this film exactly like a coach would observe her player during a match, paying attention to all the small details.

dykew3y6,1cc8s7h,1713990705.0,Ryan's World the Movie (initial review),"Ryan's World is getting a **theatrical** film in August of this year, which is quite late since their newest videos can't even get 70K views in a single day (most channels with over 100K subs do better). It should have came out in 2017-2020 since that's when Ryan's World was at its peak. Some random indie film company is distributing it, which is fine I guess, and it's being screened in over 2,100 theatres across America. Based on what I saw in the trailer, it appears to be a bland and generic film with a mix of boring live action scenes and disappointing animated scenes too. So in the film, it looks like Ryan makes videos on his own (which is a lie because of his greedy parents). The special effects look mediocre and even awful at times (check 0:12 of the trailer).

Then we have the animated scenes. They surprisingly well-animated (with it being produced by the same animation studio as freaking Doraemon), and are probably gonna be the least bad parts of the movie. I like the comic style the backgrounds are going for, everything looks colorful and full of life, and the characters translate well in the anime style. The trailer shows that there's gonna be some action scenes in the film (which is a good sigh of relief since the film is probably gonna be boring filler anyway).

Ryan's parents aren't abusive, but they're greedy narcissists who exploit their three kids (Ryan has two 7-year-old twin sisters named Emma and Kate, who are probably gonna replace the channel when Ryan gets too old). Their videos, despite being done by a production team of 30 people, are poorly-animated ([this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBg58vHVQsM&t=70s) in particular), have bland and incompetent writing, generic characters with no real personality, and are filled to the brim with product placement. They even reuse older videos so they can make the newer videos shorter while padding out the runtime.

This film just proves that Ryan's exploitation is getting somewhat worse, with his sisters now being involved. All Ryan wanted to do was play with some toys on camera back when he was three, but he got popular and his parents took advantage of that).

The film will probably be a box-office flop because nobody watches Ryan's videos anymore. The film may be decent or even good in the most part, despite all the negative stuff I've said about it. I mean don't judge a book by its cover.

2xeoqvj3,1cc6ogd,1713985645.0,One of my all-time favorite films that is rarely available for streaming is now on Amazon Prime: Out of Sight,"[Find it here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/0QX0P4SO3USZV3YA0T40XQOT37/ref=atv_dl_rdr?tag=justus1ktp-20).

For those not in-the-know, *Out of Sight* (1998) by the venerable and honored Steven Soderbergh and is an underappreciated crime flick. It's funny, intriguing, and very, very sexy.

I ignored it when it first came out. At the time George Clooney was still best known as a hunky TV doctor so I didn't have much interest in the watching it. What's more, he's paired opposite Jennifer Lopez who's still best known as a singer, so I skipped the thing.

I finally watched it with my at-the-time housemates when we were doing a Soderbergh marathon and it quickly became one of y all-time favorites.

Clooney is charming as all fuck as the lead character, and his chemistry with J-Lo is pretty amazing. Add Soderbergh's perfectionist direction and a wonderful supporting cast (Ving Rhames, Steve Zhan, Don Cheadle, Albert Brookes, Catherine Keener, Luis Guzman, Nancy Allen, Dennis Farina, and Viola Fucking Davis) and you get a magical thing.

It's based off the book of the same name by Elmore Leonard, and what's a lot of fun is it was in production at roughly the same time that Quentin Tarantino was adapting Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"" as *Jackie Brown*. That film features CIA agent Ray Nicolette as played by Michael Keaton. The novel ""Out of Sight"" also features the character, and in a fun move Miramax allowed Keaton to reprise the role for Universal's *Out of Sight* and — with the urging of Tarantino — let him do it for free. He's great in both.

If you like films about unlikely romance, jailbreaks, bank robberies, carjackings, home invasion, kidnappings, and honestly good jokes, this is a film that you should check out if you haven't fallen in love with it already.

Oh, and the soundtrack kicks ass as well.",movies

Why did Kane used the Inquirer to attack Thatcher when Thatcher provided him money and was basically his second father?

What was the exact reason why Kane forced Susan to sing and perform? I don't think it's for people to love him cause Susan was awful. Was it to just entertain himself? Or maybe finish something he started? Any other reason?

What was the exact reason why Leland left Kane? Was it because he's angry of Kane's affair? I also don't understand why Leland sent him the original paper for the ""Declaration of Principles"" (like an insult that he failed to uphold those principles) when Kane actually finished what he wrote on the way Leland wanted it to be.

Why did the other newspaper companies praise Susan on her opera performances when she was awful? Especially that Kane has no control over those companies. (Edit: Just checked the film again and they were all Inquirer newspapers from different branches, sorry. This question doesn't need to be answered anymore.)

So, a character has a board full of evidence that they’re looking at when they have a major realization. The coffee mug drops from their hand and bounces off the carpet in slow motion. It’s an Easter egg for those who have seen the Usual Suspects, but it doesn’t matter if you haven’t.

I’ve got a leg crossing and uncrossing scene like from Basic Instinct. That’s really old, mind you and might be crossing the line between classic and cliché.

I’ve got people passing round a conch to speak like in Lord of the Flies which is obviously ancient, but I believe they still teach this in school so I’m happy with this.

4gex3629,1cc2pjw,1713976326.0,My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is a masterclass in how to make a terrible movie.,"I couldn't sleep last night. The other day, someone asked me what the worst movie I ever saw was. I know there are worse ones, but this one is definitely the most recent one that stands out in my mind. And ever since, I haven't been able to get it out of my head.

I went to see *My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3* in theaters with my family last fall. The first one had been a staple in my household for over 20 years, endlessly quoted at every dinner. Last summer, we finally watched the second one (several years after it came out), and even though there were some funny parts, it didn't quite match the quality of the first one. Still, it was entertaining enough.

When the third one hit theaters, we decided we wouldn't fall behind, so we went to go see it. What a mistake.

As soon as the opening scene began with the ""family photos"" (really just screenshots from the first two movies in a picture frame slideshow template found on iMovie), I found out everything I needed to know. This was going to be a very, very bad movie.

The next two hours were agonizing and excruciating. I often found my mind wanting to wander, and I fought to pay attention to the movie playing in front of me. Not a laugh was heard throughout the entire theater. I felt like getting up, but I couldn't leave my family there.

Why was it so bad? So many reasons. There were entire scenes with characters on their own, just wandering around the beach aimlessly, with absolutely no effect on the plot or their own character development. I could tell from the actors' facial expressions that they received zero direction apart from, ""Just walk that way and look over there.""

The characters were all isolated (like in the painful final season of *How I Met Your Mother*), and any character that *did* have any sort of dialogue (like the aunt) was a caricature of themselves (I have to give her credit for trying). None of the jokes landed, and sometimes the delivery and timing was so bad that I felt myself physically cringe (squirm) in my seat.

The editing was choppy and off, sometimes cutting away too quickly and other times staying on a scene for several seconds too long. One of the characters (Victory) was endlessly annoying and unrealistic (like imagine if a kindergartener became the mayor of a town and repeated the same catchphrase in every scene). Some plot lines vanished into thin air, and other ones failed to make anyone care.

The whole thing just made me think the movie had been made as an excuse for the cast and crew to go vacation in Greece and, oh, make a movie too on the side. It was very difficult to see how Tom Hanks agreed to produce something like this. It was such a far cry from the first movie.

At the end (finally) when we walked out of the theater, my brother asked me for my honest thoughts. I turned to him and said, ""That may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.""

What other films would you consider to be “a weird tale”? That meaning a story that could be rumored-milled around town, or a campfire.

7zfekqxd,1cbxzz9,1713964756.0,"Knowing the story of the chaotic production of ""Caddyshack"", it's interesting to consider if the film would have been anywhere as good or beloved had it come out as originally intended.","For those who don't know, ""Caddyshack"" was originally supposed to be a somewhat serious/somewhat comedic coming of age story about two recent high school graduates (those being Danny Noonan and Tony D'Annuzio) working at Bushwood Country Club over the summer while trying to figure out their future plans and encountering all sorts of whacky characters in the process. But the production was a mess, fueled by inexperience (many young actors were amateurs and Harold Ramis was a first time director who had to deal with producer meddling), the weather (Hurricane Dave blew through on the first day of shooting) and massive partying/drug use (the shoot was described as ""an 11 week party, legendary even by Hollywood standards""). As such, the resulting footage was a mess, but because the seasoned comedy pros they hired for the supporting characters were good at their jobs, the film gradually morphed into an ensemble comedy abut whacky hijinks at a country club with Danny Noonan still the nominal main character (D'Annuzio however got reduced to supporting character, much to the dismay of his actor), but overshadowed by Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield (the latter two in particular getting much bigger roles than originally planned due to their renowned improvisation skills). As Ramis put it once, they planned on a coming of age film and instead made a Marx Brothers film with Dangerfield in the Groucho role, Chase as Chico, Murray as Harpo and Michael O'Keefe's Danny as the bland Zeppo equivalent. (I guess that analogy makes Knight the Margaret Dumont.) Even the gopher that Murray tangles with was a last minute addition to help tie the plot together. To say the film was a mess was a understatement.

And yet, somehow it all worked, the film was a smash and is an endearing comedy classic. If it had gone right and come out the earnest coming of age story it was intended to be, would it be as beloved as it is? Somehow, I doubt it. Sometimes a happy accident is best with a film's production.",movies

The thing I find myself thinking about most every time I see this movie is the subplot that basically sandwiches the film.

SPOILERS FOR A QUARTER CENTURY OLD MOVIE AHEAD

One of our two leads, Danny Vinyard (played by Edward Furlong) is a teenager in high school. A white high schooler is taking a beating from three black students for allegedly telling the teacher that Little Henry (played by Jason Bose Smith)--was cheating.

Danny Vinyard exits a bathroom stall, confronts Little Henry who talks a little smack, and Danny responds by taking a long drag off his cigarette and blowing the smoke in his face. Little Henry lets it go because he has to get to class. Danny helps the bullying victim up, telling him he needs to stand up for himself.

As the film concludes, we return to that same bathroom. Danny uses a urinal and in walks Little Henry, this time with a loaded handgun and shoots Danny repeatedly, killing him.

So what's your take on this subplot? The film's other lead, Edward Norton's Derek Vinyard, is the real star and focus of the plot in which he kills two black men seeking some sort of retribution for an incident at a local basketball court. His incarceration changes him significantly, partly seeing fellow neo Nazi skinheads in prison not having any real ideals they stick to, befriending a black inmate (Lamont played by Guy Torry), and his continued friendship and support from Dr. Bob Sweeny (played by Avery Brooks).

Derek gets through to his younger brother Danny and helps realize all the hate and propaganda is bullshit and fuel for angry youths who aren't actually doing anything to improve their or anyone else's situation; they're just lashing out stupidly.

Derek and Danny tear down all the Nazi propaganda and iconography and seem to be headed down a new path, all for Danny to get killed over something that didn't really seem to have anything to do with race to begin with.

So then I can't help wondering... is Derek going to go back to the way he was? His father planted the seeds of racism, his father's murder radicalized him, and then Cameron (played by Stacy Keach) turned him into the Nazi thug.

Is the film suggesting this fairly maleable character is going to turn back to his Nazi ways since his brother was murdered by a black teen, or is ""What did I do?"" as he's holding his brother's body implying he's taking responsibility? That he's not blaming others anymore?

But then... how is this his fault? Aside from Danny being white and Little Henry being black, race doesn't seem to be a factor. Yes, Danny blew smoke in Henry's face, but Henry was bullying a kid and maybe Danny would've done the same thing to a white bully. It didn't really seem like the bullying nor the smoke blowing were necessarily a racist thing either way.

I'd be interested in reading other people's thoughts on this subplot or even just how people feel about it.

fm64x,1cbroqq,1713941328.0,The Devil Wears Prada - So Many People Missed the Point,"I recently watched the Cinema Therapy episode where they discuss this movie and I made the egregious mistake of going to the comments section. Many of the top-liked comments were to the extent that the friends were horrible and that Nate (the boyfriend) in specific wasn't supportive.

Don't get me wrong - in my mid-to-late 20s, I was all about that. I was so sure that they sucked and Andy was ultimately the victim. Some years later, I see how wrong I was, and I think we really need to discuss that, as a lot of people are demanding accountability (from fictional characters) while displaying none.

Hard Truth: If you think that Nate wasn't supportive enough of Andy and her ""career"" (more on that later), you're as bad as Miranda Priestly.

Where to begin? First and foremost, the movie takes place over several months; almost a year, in fact. Nate and Andy broke up a few weeks before Paris, which means he actually endured her job for almost a whole year. That's not nothing; that's a significant amount of time, especially if you're watching a relationship deteriorate.

Second, it wasn't her career. It was a job. She didn't want to work at Runway. She didn't want to work in fashion. She wanted to be a journalist, which, as her father pointed out, she wasn't even doing. She didn't get to write articles. She made connections in the fashion world, but none of them seemed interested in advancing her career in journalism. The closest was Christian Thompson, and even he was more interested in pursuing a romance with her than seeing her as a journalist. Her time at Runway isn't even what gets her her next job. The interviewer even regards it as a blip. Her resume was already impressive enough, so that job did nothing for her.

Third, a relationship involves two people. Nate was initially supportive because he understood why Andy was doing it - an ends to a means. As the movie progressed, though, it became very clear to everyone (but Andy) that she was compromising herself for a job that she didn't want in an industry she doesn't care about. And, as time went on, she expected Nate to go along with it. People say he wasn't supportive, but what they mean is he wasn't passive. In the Age of Girlboss Feminism, everyone else is expected to take a backseat to a woman's career/job goals (and to be okay with it) or run the risk of being canceled by Tiktok/Twitter/Tumblr/etc. A certain artist who recently released an album is the peak example of this narrative. Nate wasn't asked if he was okay with it. People often quip that he should have talked to her about it. When? I know it's incredibly subtle and gets lost in subtext, but Miranda was an overbearing boss who monopolized every free minute of Andy's life. And Andy let her. She couldn't even break up with Nate properly, for crying out loud. When was Nate supposed to talk to her? He was the last person in her life to find out she was going to Paris for a week, so it doesn't seem like Andy was making communication a priority.

The fact is, Andy changed who she was to fit in. Nigel even told her to quit if she didn't want the job. She said no. And it wasn't because she was worried about being blacklisted (again, the hiring manager at the end clearly wasn't bothered by Miranda's praise) or missing out on great career opportunities. She simply remarked that it wasn't fair. She had something to prove. I get that, but if you're trying to prove your worth to someone who clearly doesn't see it or value it, you're a lost cause. I just don't see how so many people are quick to call out Grease because Sandy changed for Danny, but don't realize that in The Devil Wears Prada Andy changed for Miranda.

Was Nate perfect? No. Nobody in this movie was. Is Internet culture taking a narrative and distorting it to prove a narrative that doesn't really exist? (That Nate and the friends are the real villains?) Yes.

  
ETA: Expecting Nate to stand by Andy is like expecting Steven (Stephen?) to stand by Miranda. That's not how relationships work.",movies

Imagine elevator pitching this to an exec in Hollywood or reading the synopsis of this movie from a TV guide ""Rod raises money doing stunts to save his dad so he can kick the shit out of him."" The best! 

Scenes like Rod trying to get the attention of Denise with a mirror and then hammering on a motor to act like he is fixing it and following that up by initiating her into the crew by pouring a drink on her shoes. When Denise makes Rod shit himself and he plays it off like it didn't happen. Kevin singing George Michaels on karaoke (my fav). Rod pulling out a baton when in an argument with his dad leading to him having to go to his ""quite place"" to punch dance. Speed management on the hill... the list goes on!

55o7t,1cbpfl8,1713932956.0,Mighty Ducks 3 displays a fundamentally good thematic manner of ending a story that few franchises follow,"One thing that always makes me roll my eyes is the escalation of stakes as franchise progress. You thought the first baddie was hard because he was a world destroyer? Well the villain of #2 is a *galaxy* destroyer. Mighty Ducks 2 raised the stakes in a semi-believable manner that was still slightly corny. Mighty Ducks 3 kind of does the opposite and works great.

What makes it great is the stakes are low. It's not about taking on some mustache-twirling villains for gold medals. The climax is simply a game for pride. The core story has nothing to do with the Varsity team, it simply revolves around Charlie and his journey to learn real leadership. From not taking responsibility for committing turnovers early on, he gives one of my favorite quotes in the later act (paraphrasing): Connie: they're giving it to us pretty hard, what do we do? Charlie: we gotta buckle down, play a little defense. I know it's an actor reading a line but I love it so much. I always tell guys I play pickup ball with to always have a next-play mentality. Forget everything, your only responsibility this very moment is to get a defensive stop.

I'm so glad Ducks 3 went in this direction instead of making it be about versus galaxy champions. I know it's like critically panned but I at least think the moral is very good considering the incoming audience was people growing up on Ducks 1 and 2. Like yeah, scoring fancy goals and winning games against artificially evil bad guys is fun, but ultimately being a good teammate, person, and leader is what's most important.",movies

gg4h6,1cblom4,1713921379.0,"Movies that have gotten ""worse"" over time through no fault of their own?","I'm not talking about movies that are dated or aged poorly. I'm talking more along the lines of stuff feeling cliched even though it was novel/unique when it came out, something being referenced to death in the zeitgeist so that it just doesn't feel special anymore, or things of that nature.

This post is inspired by a recent rewatch of Robin Hood Men in Tights, which was almost unwatchable at times (hear me out before you down vote me on principle). I hadn't seen it since I was a kid and remembered liking it a lot. This recent rewatch wasn't great because so many of the jokes fall into these three categories:

(1) meta humor/winking at the camera. In 1993 this would have been a lot more unique but in today's post Office, post Deadpool, and post MCU world, having characters look directly at the camera to comment on how weird something is is just so overblown.

(2) direct references. It makes sense that a spoof movie would have references but they just aren't relevant anymore. ""Unlike other Robin Hoods I have an English accent"" makes zero sense for a modern audience because very few people remember or care about that movie. Ironically I feel like Men in Tights had a larger cultural impact than the Robin Hood movie it's comparing itself to.

(3) The best jokes have been quoted to death. This might be unique to me but I've heard so many of the best jokes in this movie quoted out of context so many times that they just weren't that funny hearing them in context. Your response to a joke is supposed to be laughter, not ""oh, that's where my buddy got that from.""

Again, none of this is the movie's fault and I'm super bummed I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did as a kid. Unlike other movies that I could say the same about, I don't think that it doesn't hold up because it's actually secretly been bad and nobody noticed at the time, I think it's because it has a lot of overused tropes that weren't overused tropes at the time and references to it have outlived the things that it references. Despite that there was still a ton I liked and even parts I laughed at because Mel Brooks is great but now I'm wondering what are some similar examples where a movie just doesn't hit the same because the world around it has changed and made it hit differently?",movies

I’m looking for the word/phrase or trope that means a person who is just different for no real reason, in a way that usually doesn’t make any sense and often doesn't drive the plot in any serious way. It’s not something they’re trying to be, it’s just a fact of their character. Usually there’s a creative or artistic element to it. It's almost always a one-dimensional character with no real personality other than being ""different."" 

It’s very, very similar to “Manic Pixie Dreamgirl” but more masculine. It’s like the kind of guy who hangs out at record stores and buys his clothes at the Salvation Army. There’s one of these guys in every coming of age movie, sometimes as the main character, sometimes as the “wise man/wise woman” who ushers the main character into adulthood.

Examples of “different guys” (or girls) from media:

* Harold from *Harold & Maude*
* The main character from *Perks of Being A Wallflower*
* The main character from *It’s Kind of A Funny Story*
* Dash from *Dash and Lilly*
* The love interest (I'm blanking on her name) from *Foxfire*
* Holden Caulfield from *Catcher In The Rye*
* Stargirl from the *Stargirl* books
* Gus from *The Fault In Our Stars*
* Anti from *Mixtape*
* Tobin from *Let It Snow*
* Jess from *Gilmore Girls*
* On that note, Kovu from *The Lion King*
* Ian from *Shameless* is kind of a satire of this trope by taking it to the extreme
* Holden Marsh from *Law and Order: SVU* also pokes fun at this trope in a very dark way
* Jimmy from *Quadrophenia* tries to be this trope, but ends up becoming a Hipster by accident
* Michael Cera plays this trope in almost every movie he stars in
* Edward Cullen, Ferris Bueller, and Christian Gray are all very similar to this trope but not identical

I’m sure I’ll add more as I think of them.",movies

Part 1 and 2 are oft considered some of, if not, the best films of all time, and after watching the first one this past week, I can definitely see why.

This week I'll be watching Part 2 (with a friend, she has seen all three of the originals before, and loves the first two), but coming to the topic of the third film, in 2020 it got a recut of sorts (of which I have of course avoided spoilers for... ASIDE FROM THE FULL TITLE OF THE MOVIE): The Godfather Coda - The Death of Michael Corleone. My friend has never watched this version, and only seen the original Part 3 once, so she is leaving it up to me. Do we watch the original, or the recut?

This isn't to say I'll never watch the other version, but after 9+ hours of Godfather over just a few weeks, it'll probably be quite some time before I get around to it. So how should I go about it? Watch the original version, as everyone else first experienced the finale to the saga? Or go with the more well-regarded recut, and avoid (presumably) most of the rough stuff?

I think there’s a lot of video game adaptions that would be likely to retell a story (which is why I would not do a Halo Master Chief movie). A lot of other games have lore that is probably too deep to adapt, or to get across in a two hour movie (I’m thinking of Mass Effect). Other preexisting video game movies IMO miss the mark completely such as DOOM and Resident Evil.

My only exposure to *Boy Kills World* was a trailer I had seen a few weeks back and frankly, I wasn't really all that interested in seeing it. But, when the movie started playing, I figured I'd give it a fair shot since I was already in the theater at that point.

# Warning: Spoilers ahead!

>!High-level overview is that the audience is introduced to a dystopian world ruled by a totalitarian familial dictatorship, and remains in power through the use of brutal force and theatrics of public execution of dissidents on live TV, called ""The Culling"". The protagonist known as and referred to as The Boy are played by the brothers Cameron and Nicolas Crovetti, and the adult version played by Bill Skarsgard. Oh yeah, and since The Boy is a deaf-mute (due to a montage of explanatory torture imagery), his ""inner voice"" / lazy exposition explainer is played by H. Jon Benjamin.!<

>!All this tees-up a revenge plot as thin as Skarsgard's wiry frame.!<

>!The characters The Boy meets along the way are either parodies of one-dimensional side-kicks, B-plot villains, and field-bosses, or are just one-dimensional side kicks, B-plot villains, and field-bosses.!<

>!Fight scenes are meant to bedazzle and try to pay homage to ultra violent, highly stylized grindehouse flicks, samurai films, and kung-fu cinema, but ends up being a 13-year old's poor attempt to rip-off Tarantino's *Kill Bill* duology. In fact, one of the most prominent problems with *Boy Kills World* is its pacing, which becomes fatiguing and exhaustive in its quest for blood, gory violence. Worst of all, it becomes boring.!<

>!Even the film's attempt to reveal some plot twists fall short of making this movie engaging. The helmeted female field-boss? Yup, it's The Boy's sister. The matriarch dictator? Yup, the Boy's mom. The Shaman who trained The Boy to avenge his family? Yup, he was really the bad guy using The Boy for his own revenge.!<

>!Very rarely does the script make good use of H. Jon Benjamin's voice acting. And perhaps it's just the over-exposure of Benjamin's voice with years of voicing highly recognizable and beloved characters such as Coach McGuirk, Ben Katz, Sterling Archer, and Bob Belcher.!<

>!The only brilliant moments are when the movie acknowledges that The Boy is deaf (and this movie at times forgets that), and is unable to decipher one side-character's lips and the audience gets to be cued in to what The Boy humorously and erroneously thinks the side-character is saying.!<

>!If you're looking for a way to kill 2 hours, through loud, meaningless, shallow non-stop violence, *Boy Kills World* will slay those 2 hours.!<",movies

&#x200B;

\- why are people going wearing sweaters and jackets? when Hooper arrives, why is he wearing a black wool knit winter cap? why is Quint wearing a military field coat? isn't it almost July?

&#x200B;

\- how does Ben Gardner's boat have a huge hole in the hull, but it hasn't sunk? and how did his head get way down into the ship's hold? why would he be *in* the ship's hold, and wouldn't Bruce have to get inside there with him in to bite off everything and leave his head behind?

&#x200B;

\- why are guys throwing dynamite and fireworks overboard during the shark hunt? is it to attract the shark, or are they throwing around explosives blindly hoping one will hit Bruce?

&#x200B;

\- my favorite line in the movie: ""a whuuuut?"" but how do two veteran fisherman, who almost definitely grew up near the water, not know what a tiger shark is?

&#x200B;

\- who the hell are all the guys posing for the newspaper picture? Hendricks and Brody are local cops, fine...and the two guys who hooked the tiger shark are in it....but who are the other 10-15 dudes standing in the shot?

&#x200B;

\- why are there 50 guys with hunting rifles deputed to patrol/protect the beach? is that how they do it? a shark shows up and they give it the Bonnie and Clyde treatment, pumping it full of lead, even though the water is full of swimmers and the beach is packed with vacationers?

&#x200B;

\- what's up with those crazy nurse caps in the hospital? i grew up in the 80s, and i've never seen anything remotely like those caps in person or anywhere on google.

&#x200B;

\- why is Quint shown boiling shark jaws? wouldn't shark jaws dissolve in boiling water, leaving nothing but the teeth? is he using the teeth for mounting purposes (like the taxidermied jaws in his shack)?

&#x200B;

\- why is the Orca built so you have to clamber across the slippery port side gunwale to reach the forecastle (forward)? isn't that extremely dangerous? are any ships really built this way?

&#x200B;

\- aboard the Orca, Hooper says the distant sound is a whale call. does anyone know what whale it's supposed to be? i've only heard whale calls that are deep booming bass and squeaks and clicks. and how could you hear whale calls *above* water?

&#x200B;

\- at first, Hooper seems super stoked about encountering this one-of-a-kind shark. he even tags it for tracking later (i'm guessing by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute). shortly after, he seems intent on killing it by sticking it with a spike syringe loaded with cyanide. what gives?

> Le Pacte is a French motion picture company headquartered in Paris. It specializes in film distribution, co-productions and international sales. It was founded by Jean Labadie in November 2007, shortly after he was forced out of his previous company, BAC Films. Since its creation, it has become one of the largest independent French distribution companies. It had a record number of admissions in 2019 with more than 6.5 million cumulative admissions.

> **Coppola's ""Megalopolis"" to be distributed in France by Le Pacte**

> Philippe Guedj

> The suspense is over: just as speculation was running wild over the distribution of Megalopolis, the high-risk sci-fi blockbuster presented by director Francis Ford Coppola at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival, Le Point Pop learns from sources close to the matter that the independent company Le Pacte will obtain exclusive distribution rights for the film in French cinemas. ""It's going to be a real sport,"" says a film professional, referring to the uncertain commercial potential of the 26th feature from one of Hollywood's greatest living directors. In accordance with the filmmaker's wishes, however, this extraordinary work will indeed be seen on the big screen in France.


> Scheduled for release in multiplexes in France at the end of September, Megalopolis is said to have cost between $120 and $130 million. The screenplay, which Coppola has been working on for four decades, focuses on the struggle for influence between two men involved in rebuilding a major American megalopolis (New York?) after a cataclysm in the near future. The two rivals are a visionary architect (played by Adam Driver), with ambitions for a city based on ecologically virtuous growth, and the city's mayor (Giancarlo Esposito), the embodiment of an old world with corrupt methods.

> Self-financed by the director of The Godfather, who had to do without the support of a major studio for this kamikaze adventure, Megalopolis will be screened in competition on the Croisette, surrounded by a double aura of excitement and mistrust - the most skeptical fear a pensum of over two hours that risks scaring off the crowds with its excessive rejection of convention. Founder and president of Le Pacte, after having created other renowned companies such as BAC, Mars and Wild Side, Jean Labadie boasts an impressive track record of demanding, often commercially risky, French and international feature films.

> Among other titles, Le Pacte has distributed in France such works as Drive, Snowpiercer, Timbuktu, Les Misérables, Roubaix, une lumière, Dark Waters, La Syndicaliste, Jeanne du Barry and, more recently, the phenomenal Anatomy of a Fall and Borgo. We can imagine that Le Pacte's cash flow, recently galvanized by the box office and worldwide sales of Justine Triet's Palme d'Or, has put the company in pole position in negotiations with Coppola.

tvdg51fzf,1cba9ue,1713892801.0,Why did the comic relief die? ,"Are there any movies with tough action heroes that don't joke around anymore? 

Back in my day the action hero was tough and they rarely broke character which attached value to the joke. 

Reason being... We had comic reliefs. 

Bruce Willys remained tough on 5th Element and Chris Tucker undertook the role of the jackass. 

Joe Pesci was the comic relief in Lethal Weapon. 

Sly Stalone was the tough guy and Rob Schneider the ridiculous jackass. 

Even Will Smith was the tough guy in Independence day and we had numerous other comic reliefs, including the psycho redneck and Data. 

But now? 

Think about it. 

Every action hero also undertakes the role of the comic relief in his own movie. 

Turning himself into a joke. 

Mamoa in the latest Aquaman movie. 

Thor jesus what they ve done with him? 

I can think of countless examples.

nrvkezbi,1cb8k06,1713888676.0,What's the inverse of Plot Armor?,"*Plot armor:* ***a plot device wherein a fictional character is preserved from harm due to their necessity for the plot to proceed***\*.\*

So what's the opposite of that? Wherein otherwise competent protagonist(s) suffer repeated unexplained bursts of incompetence, fundamental skills lapse, or forget they can do certain things, for the sole purpose of allowing the plot to move along.

Edit to clarify: I’m not talking about “character dies quickly-easily” like a Redshirt, or “character does stupid things” (white people in any haunted-house movie). I’m talking about when a character *whose competence has already been established* suddenly turns dumb strictly because otherwise the story would be over in the first act.  

I finally got around to watching the first season of *Jack Ryan* on Amazon and it occurred to me that every single element of the Big Bad's plot succeeding completely hinges upon the utter incompetence of hundreds of professionals from dozens of US agencies, including them making inexplicably dumb decisions that are actually significantly harder than other choices they had available to them (never mind what they'd actually do IRL). If any one of them had said, ""Hey wait, maybe we shouldn't do that, because it's stupid,"" the plot screeches to a halt.

Maybe another example is the recent *Top Gun* sequel. Instead of using B-2 stealth bombers with bunker-busting weapons specifically designed for targets exactly like the one in question...or even using the whole Navy carrier air wing that is right there on the ship with them, including aircraft whose entire purpose is to jam and attack SAMs and their guidance radars...they instead go with a bare-bones strike package which has statistically no chance of success and will get absolutely clobbered with missiles...because it looks cooler.",movies

Personally, I was let down one of the that the beast was going to be one of the best art house movies of the year if not the last couple of years. 

Personally, I was let down one of the biggest reasons for this was the acting by Lea Seydoux and George McKay. biggest reasons for this was the acting by Leo and McKay.

There’s just some thing about Seydoux that I can’t pinpoint. I don’t know if it’s just her acting, which I actually find kind of bad or if it’s something else.  she seemed like she was in a remedial acting class. I *could tell* she was acting if that makes sense, it’s not a good thing either way.

It’s just something about her responses to questions in the scene. She seems like she’s overthinking things or *thinking” about acting abd she’ll respond… by acting. She seems like she’s acting and trying to figure out choices in real time and being totally un natural. 

For a minute, I thought this was supposed to be something related to the character in the film itself but no, I think she’s just a shit actor. she *is* a shit actor. There is something off about her. 

I can’t comprehend why she’s such a big star when there are better actors in a community college acting class. Hell,  I’ve seen better acting in high school plays… George McKay on the other hand…. 

McKay just fucking sucks. Something about his dead eyes, just a weird looking dude, almost stereotypical lesbian looking in some aspects. I did not buy him for a second in this role. 

The film itself was OK. There should’ve been another story added, and one of the story should’ve been cut by a lot. I’m not gonna spoil anything, but you’ll see when you get there as it gets to become a little tedious. Films an exercise in patience.

Oh, it was nice tray. I enjoy some good fun science fiction and this had all the ingredients to be become something classic it just wasn’t. It was a poor shit action Oh, it was nice tray.

Zack Snyder's Justice League, Grand Budhapest Hotel, I've Been Thinking of Ending Things... 

I can't fully put into words why I love it so much. I think it's because it gives me a feeling of looking through a window into the worlds on screen, but maybe more importantly is the feeling of symmetry, and the feeling of looking at a wall painting that is alive. With the square format, I feel that no space is wasted in the frame. Symmetry in the image becomes even more powerful since the frame itself is square. Big things, like buildings, strong characters, etc. feel somehow even more powerful when the space is so crammed compared to 16:9 or scope. Composition of elements in the frame feel almost naturally pleasant and fitting, because, again, there's almost no dead/empty space so all the space compliments other elements so well. It also feels very portrait-y, again almost like a wall picture coming to life, due to the boxed-in format. And of course, it feels very vintage and nostalgic.

It's almost starting to detract from the movies' impact on me.

Horror comedies are becoming more enjoyable to me because they're not relying so heavily on being miserable. One thing I've always liked about The Host (2006) is the creature attacks happening in places like happy, sunny parks.

From its meticulous attention to detail, from the exquisite cinematography to the intricate costume and set design. Moreover, the stellar performances from the cast added depth and authenticity to the narrative. Yorgos just don’t miss! However, I can't help but feel conflicted about its ending.

Throughout the journey of Bella Baxter, we witness her transformation not only intellectually but also emotionally. Despite encountering the darkest facets of humanity, Bella remains a beacon of hope and optimism, believing in the potential for redemption and understanding. Her compassionate nature and caring heart shine through, even in the face of adversity.

Yet, the ending of the film seems to diverge sharply from Bella's established character arc. When she subjects Alfie to a brain transplant with that of a goat. This to me feels jarringly inconsistent with her beliefs and growth throughout the film. While Alfie's actions were undeniably heinous, Bella's decision to condemn him to a life of crawling on all fours and consuming grass(as fucking hilarious as it was) seems to contradict her overarching message of compassion and forgiveness.

What's particularly perplexing is Bella's own criticism of Max and Godwin for their actions towards Felicity, which she perceives as morally reprehensible. Yet, in a twist of irony, Bella herself ends up committing a similar act, albeit in a more extreme fashion. While her actions at Alfie's manor we’re obvious self-defense, her subsequent choice to subject him to a fate worse than death raised questions for me about her character's integrity and the consistency of her moral compass.

Given that Alfie would stop at nothing to have Bella, or “Victoria” back it does make sense why they can’t let him leave. He essentially claimed Bella as his property and refused to let her go. I can understand why drastic actions needed to be taken, I just can’t help but feel conflicted.

6h5pjow,1cast1m,1713837617.0,Batman Returns: Too much Burtonized ,"One thing I like about the first Batman movie was that even though Tim Burton directed it, it didn’t have too much of that weird gothic Tim Burton feel like he did with Edward’s Scissorhands or The Nightmare Before Christmas (both are good movies). Like Warner Brothers executives made sure Burton did not go too over the top. 

With Returns, it felt like Burton was given free reign and he allowed himself to make it dark and a little weird. 

I don’t know, it just felt like a typical Burton movie with Batman tagging along because he had to. 

Even the music from Danny Elfman has more weird gothic overtones than the first film.

I may have misunderstood something, but the rape and misogyny in this movie were so disturbing, and I was hoping that Rosemary would rise above it all like it seems like she’s painfully building up to do in the movie, and then in the end, she suddenly is so overtaken by maternal instinct that every other feeling she has is just swept away? It was such a slap in the face. It was visually striking, and I thought it had a great score, but overall it just felt so lackluster. Then when I found out the director raped a 13 year old after I finished the movie, it just made my disgust so much deeper. I’m normally one to separate art from artist, but I can’t help but believe he made this movie out of a sick fantasy he had, and somehow it’s beloved and the top rated horror movie on IMDb. So disappointing. 

Edit: I want to explain that I am usually a fan of uncomfortable narrative with tragic endings. That is not my problem with this film. I just don’t understand how her mindset did a literal 180 within seconds at the end of the movie, and what made that happen. If she loved the baby more than her negative feelings about the situation, why wouldn’t she have felt that way since the beginning? I just feel like this ending was stuck on for shock value and that was it, and it makes her mindset throughout the entire movie leading up to it feel so disingenuous.

High school teacher, Rainer Wegner, may be popular with the students, but he's also unorthodox. He's forced to teach Autocracy for the school's project week. He's less than enthusiastic at first, but the response of the students is surprising to say the least.

-WHY does a movie have alternate (or more) endings?

-Maybe the movie producer tries to ""please"" audience with different preferences.

According to WIKIPEDIA, the two different endings are as follows.

**version1:**

As the Darkseekers attack the lab, discovering the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as the Darkseeker alpha male rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured, and gives it to Anna, before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then kills both himself and the attacking Darkseekers with a grenade, saving the cure.

The following day, Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors' camp in Bethel, where they are greeted by military officers and other survivors before Anna hands them the cure. Anna narrates how Neville's efforts and sacrifices to save humanity ultimately became legend.

**version2:**

As the Darkseekers attack the lab, the alpha male Darkseeker creates a butterfly shape while attempting to break through the glass to the laboratory. Neville realizes it is referencing the butterfly-shaped tattoo on the female Darkseeker's neck and the alpha male and his followers have simply been trying to recover his mate. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down and Neville apologizes after seeing the latter emotionally respond to his mate's return. The alpha male departs with the rest of the pack. Once they are gone, a shocked Neville looks over at the many pictures of his test subjects and realizes he has become a monster in the eyes of the infected, showing remorse for the experiments he has undertaken over the years.

The next morning, Neville abandons his research and heads along with Anna and Ethan to Vermont as a changed man, in the hope of finding the survivors' colony. They cross the George Washington Bridge, while Anna delivers a hopeful monologue ending with the statement: ""You are not alone.""

4s5is,1ca9jxd,1713789194.0,Would Léon: The Professional be better without the subplot of Mathilda falling in love with Léon?,"Although generally well liked by critics and audiences, the one glaring and uncomfortable aspect of Léon is the subplot of a 12-year-old girl falling in love with her hitman guardian and mentor, Léon. 

Although the movie thankfully spares the audience of actually ""going there"" with Léon steadfast in refusing Mathilda's advances, it's undoubtedly uncomfortable for viewers.

tn0g5ayx8,1ca85ev,1713784857.0,"Memento - specific theory, detailed description","I have a specific theory about Nolan's Memento that I feel strongly about, for which I think there is the strongest evidence, and which I think is interesting. To explain it briefly, I will write it assuming people know the basic ideas of the movie plot and focus on my theory of what happened with the story that wasn't presented on the screen.

So my main part of the theory is that I think Teddy had something to do with Leonard before we saw him on the screen. I mean even before those black-and-white scenes, and further. As he mentioned himself, he may have been assigned as a policeman to that case where Leonard got the brain damage. He may have also only heard about it from other policemen he worked with, but to go further, and the thing that I think is more important, I actually think he may have also had something to do with breaking into Leonard's house, directly or not. The reason for it is that, first, we know he's a corrupt cop dealing with drugs and has no problem with harming others, not to mention his deceitfulness, which we learn all through the movie. The second reason is, as Leonard says from the notes he gathered about the crime he's avenging, that the perpetrators had a car stashed with drugs outside.

From the assumption that Teddy knew Leonard before the main plot of the movie as a corrupt cop and a drug dealer, we can get many pieces that fit well in their place. Teddy would want to know what Leonard is doing because he's a witness who potentially would be able to testify that there was one other person during the breaking. When realizing he doesn't pose a danger to him, he may then realize he can use his need for revenge and also manipulate him. At first, he may have helped him kill the perpetrator of the crime Leonard is avenging. It could be, for example, a person who has irresponsibly lost drugs that he could profit from—the ones that police seized afterwards. We know that at one point Leonard thought he probably avenged the killing of his wife. Someone has made a picture of him smiling, where he is pointing to a place on his chest on the heart place where he would put another tattoo. This place would have a writing ""I've done it"". He imagined that in the scene at the end, with his narration in the background about need in believing in what he's doing in his search.

We knew that Teddy withheld the picture because he later slipped it to Leonard under the door. For example, he may have made Leonard forget he avenged his wife; it could have happened in a way similar to how Natalie deceived Leonard when she did. Teddy may have mocked Leonard while withholding the picture, for example, at gunpoint, and said things that he would make him kill another time. That could make Leonard create tattoo ""never answer the phone"" in the tattoo shop.

Jimmy Grantz may have known about the things Teddy is doing with Leonard, about killing and deceiving him; that's why he was so derisive to him at the beginning of their interaction, when he didn't know he would be his next target right before it. He called him ""memory men"" and asked if he's expecting any other Jimmies in the place they met. We also know Jimmy told Natalie about Leonard, his condition, and his check-in at a specific motel. 

After Leonard's correct kill, Teddy may have manipulated Leonard into killing Jimmy Grants, which Teddy could have profited from as well. He set up their meeting and convinced Leonard he's the real killer. After that, something for Leonard doesn't feel right; he gets suspicious, even paranoid, to the point that he even thinks that Jimmy's dead body mentioned Sammy Jenkins. Then Teddy comes in; he mostly lies to Leonard but also admits he made him kill someone Leonard didn't want to. Leonard gets angry at what he made him do and plans to make him his target by giving himself clues that he's the real killer of his wife. 

This theory wouldn't look like Leonard is that easily manipulated into killing and looking so delusional or psychotic, which I don't think would fit. I know he had brain damage with the condition, but there are countless examples in the movie when he shows how smart he was and that he had good intuition. At the same time, he was well motivated because the last thing he memorized gave him that strong drive to solve the crime. He also had extensive knowledge of the condition from the time he was an investigator. Also, it's noted that he was good at his job. He mentioned that in his work, he dealt a lot with cops, and they helped him with notes.

I also like the theory because there is a nice theme to it. Leonard got his justice, even though it wasn't perfect, and people related to his wife's death were punished, including people who manipulated him into doing something he didn't want to do because of it.

From what I researched, Nolan wasn't that clear in explaining what happened, but he pointed out that the audience tended to unfairly not believe Teddy. In my opinion, this description of Teddy may fit the theory, because even though Teddy was lying, even to a degree of contradicting himself in front of Leonard, it would appear he did reveal the truth, at least to some degree.

In the end, I want to exclude theories that I don't think have merit. I don't think Leonard made up Sammy. Also, I don't think he killed his wife himself with insulin. I know that in the end, there are quick flashes of image when Sammy turns into Leonard in the institution. There is also another scene where Leonard injects his wife with insulin and another where his wife is blinking through a transparent cloth. In my opinion, Sammy turning into Leonard was to show how similar Leonard feels to Sammy. On the other hand, the other flashes present confusion in Leonard's head at that time because of what Teddy was saying. I could speak more about why I don't think the other interpretations of those flashes, assuming Leonard makes up Sammy, don't fit that well. At the same time, as I mentioned, I think Leonard was indeed hallucinating Jimmy mentioning Sammy. At that time, I think Jimmy was already dead, and I think it was Leonard's subconscious intuition speaking, because something didn't feel right for him. The flash of injecting insulin and the hallucination fit with the confusion he felt in that situation that he was put in because of Teddy.

The other theory I'm suspicious of is that Leonard killed many other people than those two I describe and Teddy. I know Teddy is suggesting this, but he lied a lot at the same time to confuse Leonard. In my opinion, there wasn't that much time for Leonard to kill between the robbery and the events of the movie. The evidence I see seems to show that the time of the robbery wasn't that distant from the main plot of the movie. I could also talk more about it.

&#x200B;

I wanted to share this theory for a long time. I reminded myself of the movie recently in a brief way, but back in the day, I explored it in detail. It's just the theory, and I don't think there is definite proof for it, but I think it's a pretty good one.",movies

It leaned HEAVY into the loss aspect of war and I was not vibing with it. I know that’s how war really is and it’s a sad as hell thing, so it’s realistic but I’m gonna keep it real… I don’t like to cry. It feels unpleasant, makes my sinuses act up, and it makes me depressed for the rest of the day. SO… Looking for some of the least sad war movies out there.

I couldn't help but feel the film wanted to push Popeye and even his partner in a bad light. Criticizing their constant arrests and assaults on low-level criminals who don't really deserve all the attention and harassment those two bring to them. I almost feel that this movie presents this method as asinine. It clearly shows that not even the justice system puts as much value or concern into any of these people based on how little time they spend in jail. Could be a criticism of the justice system but I saw it more as almost an advocacy or reason to decriminalize drugs and to find new methods to combat drug use and trafficking instead of constantly shaking down/throwing low-level dealers or users in jail.

2. In T2, how did the T1000 use the Time Machine?  It has no living tissue.  Even if it can mimic living tissue it’s not real and breaks the rule of the Time Machine of the first movie.

3. In the original terminator movie, what happened to the rest of the terminator?  I know it was crushed but seems like the there would be more left than just the hand and one chip.

First scene: There was that character (who was kind of clumsy/naïve/stupid) who jumped off a wall. Once on the ground, hands in his face threw that line: Am I dead?

Second scene: The final fight, the bad guy was killed by the protagonists (many fighters) who throwed knives and weapons sticking on his chest to kill him.

3imesby,1c9xmp7,1713746783.0,Curious about your guys' takes on the purpose of advertisements in Dream Scenario.,"[TMBD](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/823482-dream-scenario?language=en-US)

Heavy spoilers ahead, all tagged out. If you have any intention of watching this film, I suggest you do it blind, and skip this post.

>!I recently finished Dream Scenario. I think it is a spectacular film,  but I don't fully understand the intention of including the in-dream advertisements. It's introduced very late into the film, there only being 15 minutes left when they show the Norio, a device that allows you to enter other people's dreams, and the creator of the Norio explains the intention of advertising.!<

>!I do understand how the Norio is necessary to wrap up Paul Matthews' arc. In the beginning of the film, he is upset that he does nothing in these people's dreams. While buildings collapse and alligators attack, he stands still, an observer in their subconscious minds. He is inconsequential. This mirrors Paul's real life. He is boring, uninteresting, and passive. He makes no great moves. When someone steals an idea of his (appropriately the idea relates to the behavior of a hive mind) he meets with them, and instead of threatening legal action, or going off on them for ripping off his work, he pleads with them, begging to be recognized in their research. For all intents and purposes, Paul is a pathetic person, and in the communal subconscious of the world, people's dreams reflect that.!<

>!At the end of the film, Paul takes action against people. He is upset that he is being villainized for the subconscious fantasies of other people, and he becomes more proactive to fight for his personal rights. Paul gets his hands on a Norio, and enters into the dream of his wife, where he helps her escape a wall of fire, trapping her against a pillar. When Paul is actually physically capable of controlling himself in the dreams, he is active and helpful, which is more reflective of who Paul wants to be.!<

>!All of this is well and good, but the inclusion of the advertisements doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't service Paul's arc, nor does it contribute to the commentary on cancel culture. It does introduce the Norio to the audience, but is communicated more as a tool for advertisers, and it didn't even occur to me until Paul got his hands on one that anyone could just buy one, so in my opinion I don't think the scene does a good job of that. There is another minor scene shortly after this where two individuals try to advertise things to Paul in his dreams, but this doesn't really seem to service the plot in any way either.!<

I assume I am just misunderstanding the intention of these scenes, or am maybe just ignorant to another message that was included in this film. What do you guys think? Is it possible these scenes are remnants of a prior script, one that comments on the effect of subconscious advertising? ",movies
6xdgzr98,1c9xkc0,1713746585.0,Is Friday The 13th the movies series that changed the most over the years?,"I'm not talking about films like Halloween III that suddenly took left turns but rather films that changed little by little over the course of several films to become something else altogether.

The most obvious answer is the Fast and The Furious films which went from DVD player thieves to international spies over the twenty years.

But it's still the same core group of actors doing impossible stunts while talking about family.

The initial Rambo film explores the impact of PTSD and veteran treatment, while the sequels become intense celebrations of warfare.

I'd argue that Friday the 13th changed the most. The second film changed who the killer was. The third film changed how he looked, introducing the hockey mask. The sixth film introduce supernatural elements. The tenth film changed the genre to science fiction, sending Jason into space.

r4oblv499,1c9wcyj,1713743046.0,Sasquatch Sunset is a fantastically odd film that should be seen be all,"I was able to see Sasquatch Sunset this weekend. I was immediately fascinated with the concept when I first saw the trailer. No dialogue, actors covered in costumes and makeup, and apparent comedic undertones. Seemed to be up my alley.

I was really hoping going in that it didn't end up being a pretentious art film, and it certainly was not. There were comedic moments, but it was never the focus of the movie.

As a whole, it has such an amazing heart. You really begin to feel and identify with the characters immediately (or at least I did). This makes the sad moments hit harder, and the touching moments that much more impactful.

With a runtime of 89 minutes, it also doesn't outstay its welcome.

I can see how this would be a love it or hate movie with no real middle ground. I however loved it. There is no spoken dialogue (just grunts and howls), yet I was never once confused by what was going on, or the purpose of any of the scenes. The actors here did a tremendous job. Adding all of that with a perfectly fitting soundtrack, and the gorgeous backdrop of the north California mountains, I believe this should be destined to be a beloved cult classic. Can't recommend it enough for some odd weekend fun.

Donnie Yen's friend has been killed for losing a 3 on 1 sparring match against Japanese occupiers. He goes to request to fight 10 men. The movie makes it clear that the kind hearted sifu is out for revenge, not justice. The colors fade to grim greys. The music is tense and solemn, not heroic and exciting.

And the choreography, wow, it speaks more than dialogue could. Earlier in the movie Donnie is attacked with a sword in his own home, and he uses a feather duster to disarm and humiliate his opponent. This time, he hurls his first attacker to the ground and stomps on his neck, moving to the next opponent before his first victim's head stops limply wobbling. And then you consider the historical context and appreciate how cathartic it is for a Chinese man to be beating up WW2 Japanese.

But it is the WORST example of ""lets attack him one at time"" I have seen in a movie. They try to keep the camera tightly focused on Donnie Yen but you can still see fighters in the background doing nothing but flailing their arms, swaying side to side, and watching him beat the everliving crap out of one person.

Also it's 10 fighters against him and three ""squads"" are named to fight Donnie so they don't have equal numbers per squad which bothers me more than it should.

Sequels, prequels, original ideas..let's hear it!

My idea:

I'd love to see a movie about a possessed man or woman and have it be from his/her perspective. Show this person working, behaving in a negative fashion, crossing ethic lines and have the possession come into focus late into the movie (hearing voices, seeing imagery) and have the audience slowly come to the conclusion of possession. Maybe even make it a bit ambiguous in the end if it actually was that or just a psychological problem and give just enough examples to explain both sides of the argument. Forgo all the exorcism antics and vomit tropes of the genre and make it into a psychological thriller and have the director never pick a side. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and in the lead I'd cast Jodie Comer who is very good linguistically and have that play into the part of possession. (Have her speak many languages in the film only to later find out nobody knew she'd speak anything else but English for example) and as a supporting cast I'd use unknowns.",movies

I'd like to say how much I appreciate I'm Not There as an unconventional biopic that fit so well with the ever changing persona of Dylan. I really appreciate how the movie explores how different people can be at different stages of their lives, and doesn't shoehorn Dylan into a single persona like so many othe biopics do with their subjects. It also seems like it anticipated the satire of Walk Hard (also 2007), and reinvented what a dramatic music biopic could look like. Walk Hard questioned why we made biopics like this and I'm Not There preemptively answered that we don't have to.

Good things; Jake G, obviously. I almost always enjoy his movies. I thought the first 15 minutes or so was done well.

What I enjoyed most was that the characters were all highly competent fighters and yet they suffered or even lost their fights quite a lot.

This reminded me a lot of old action movies, particularly Jackie Chan films or early Die Hard where the protagonist was not some invincible monster. There were real stakes. The characters got hurt.

I don’t want to dump on any specific films or franchises but many modern films have completely missed this for me. Fights are boring because nobody ever looks like they are in danger or gets hurt.

A lot of what works in Bullet Train comes from the choreography which was very creative, dynamic and actually used the gimmick of the train rather than it feeling like generic choreo that would work in any location. The location of the train comes in to play at every moment. It was a breath of fresh air.

So I ask: What other recent movies - specifically action movies I guess (though this isn’t unique to action films) - did fight scenes have such good tension and stakes where lead characters actually suffer, are on the back foot, get hurt, or even die?

ov9v6mywc,1c9mpf2,1713718518.0,"Which is the best and worst Diane Lane film, in your opinion, and why?","The best has to be Unfaithful because she was nominated for that movie, and probably should have won if I'm honest, it's an absolutely fearless performance from her and one which you wouldn't expect from her. As beautiful as Diane Lane was, she always came across as a cold fish when it came to being sexy and sensual, but in Unfaithful she just embraces it, and it's not just a erotic film but a serious drama about a woman's moral journey. I loved it. 

The worst Diane Lane film has to be the godawful The Glass House just because she got such a demeaning part. Given her star power, she should have been the main villain, but instead the movie turns her into just a sidekick who's a drug addict. They don't even explore her addiction or that she's not as bad as Stellan Skarsgaard, they just have her go all Kelly Taylor by being all pill crackie and then do a whole lot of crying and that was it.

8q93v6f8,1c9lif1,1713715454.0,Roles Cate Blanchett turned down,"The Queen of Acting and supercoolness has had and still has an extraordinary career in both film, television and on stage. Here is a small list of roles she declined for different reasons 

01) Portia 
Blanchett was the original choice to play Portia in this Michael Redford adaption of The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare. Blanchett had to drop out in the last minute due to pregnancy. We were robbed of Blanchett and Pacino acting together. The interesting thing is that Ian McKellen was also cast in the movie and dropped out in the last minute due to scheduling conflicts. So we were also robbed by Ian and Cate acting once again in the same movie. 
The cast is: Al Pacino, Lynn Collins, Jeremy Irons, Charlie Cox, Joseph Fiennes etc 

02) Anna 
Cate Blanchett had to drop out right before filming started due to pregnancy. Director Mike Nichols had to recast the role of Anna. The candidate were Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts. He went with Roberts. This role became like a renessaince for Julia Roberts in getting better and more dramatic work in the future to come. We were robbed of Blanchett acting with Law, Owen and Portman. I believe the decision to drop out of this really hurt Blanchett. The script is adapted by Patrick Marber. Marber later wrote a role for Blanchett in Notes on a Scandal. I believe Closer would have been a way better movie with Blanchett. Her delivery of Anna’s line would have been so fire! And hopefully, in fantasy land, netted her a second best actress nomination and a possible double nomination since this is the same year as The Aviator. 
The cast: Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. 

03) Marianne Lane 
Cate Blanchett was the original choice to play Marianne Lane in A Bigger Splash, directed by Luca Guadagnino. Tilda Swinton replaced her and the rest is history. Since the replacement is as strong as Blanchett itself, I have no complaints. But we were robbed of a reunion between Blanchett and Fiennes since their Oscar and Lucinda days. Blanchett declined due to her on stage performance in The Maids with Isabelle Huppert and Elizabeth Debicki in New York. Margot Robbie was also originally cast but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. We were robbed of a possible Aussie duo Cate-Margot fire on screen together. 
The cast: Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Dakota Johnson and Matthias Schoenarts 

04) Agatha 
Blanchett was committed to play Agatha in Minority Report by Steven Spielberg. But because Spielberg wanted to do A.I first, the filming was postponed from late 1999 to April 2001. Blanchett dropped out due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by Samantha Morton. Morton was fantastic as Agatha so no complaints here. Both Ian McKellen and Meryl Streep were also attached to the movie, but that did not happen. We were robbed once again with a possible Cate-Ian duo on screen and Blanchett with Tom Cruise as well. 
The cast: Samantha Morton, Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, Jessica Capshaw and more. 

05) Isabel / Izzi Creo 
In early 2002, Blanchett and Brad Pitt was about to start shooting The Fountain by Darren Aronofsky. But because Pitt and Aronofsky had major creative differences, the project was shut down. The roles were recast in 2004 with Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Though Weisz is a good actress, I am still curious about what Blanchett could do in an Aronofsky movie.
 The cast: Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, Ellen Burstyn etc 

06) Francis Ford Coppola 
Cate Blanchett mention she had been contacted by Francis Ford Coppola for a role “When Francis calls, just have to say yes. Because you’re on the epic life-changing adventure ride. You’re on that roller coaster. I’m ready for that” 

Well she dropped out of Megapolis so what ever happen that, I dunno

07) Lucille Ball 
For many, many years, Cate Blanchett has talked about Lucille Ball and potentially playing her. She was cast with Aron Sorkin both directing and writing. Blanchett dropped because the movie went in a direction she was not ready for. Kidman was replaced and the result was not very good at all. Oscar Isaac was in talks as well

08) Pay gap difference in spring 2018
She was offered a lead role and getting lesser paid than her male co-lead. Cate tried to negotiate with the studio but they said no. And so did she. The greatest actress in the world with two Oscars and highly acclaimed movies, could not get equal pay in 2018. That is so gross 

09) Considered for 
Clarice Starling in Hannibal / Ada in Cold Mountain/  Roxy Heart in Chicago / Evelyn Johnson in Pearl Harbor / Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable / Jane Smith in Mr & Mrs Smith/ Hippolyta in Wonder Woman

10) Illeana 
Cate was offered the role of Illeana in Taking Lives by D.J. Caruso. Angelina Jolie got the part. The cast: Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Gena Rowlands, Kiefer Sutherland, Olivier Martinez etc 

11) Mrs Fox
 Blanchett was set to voice Mrs Fox in the Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr Fox, but was replaced by Meryl Streep for undisclosed reasons

12) Melissa Lewis 
Blanchett was committed to play Melissa Lewis in The Martian, but had to drop out due to her on stage schedule with The Maids in New York. Jessica Chastain replaced her. I’m glad she dropped out because the role itself is not that much. Chastain is a good replacement and doing her best 

13) more to come

3wtw9ezy,1c9hxj3,1713706190.0,My thoughts on The Virgin Suicides (1999) - an essay ,"TL;DR - this movie is a story of what happens when one is dehumanised, turned into someone's fantasy, an object of desires and therefore deprived of meaningful connections. That is the answer to the question of ""Why they did it?"" in my opinion.


I just saw the movie, and wanted to share my perception of it. I've seen a lot of comments about how the movie didn't explain things properly and it's unclear why the girls did what they did.

But, I think the main message it's pretty clear.

First of all, right from the beginning, it's important to keep in my that the story is told from the boys™ perspective. It's how they remember the story.

But, as a viewer, you must catch things that are reality to better understand the girls.

Now, one thing I noticed - its often repeated how the parents' attitude and strictness were main reason for girls ending their lives, but I actually disagree. They were strict, for sure, but look at the girls lifestyles and clothing? They all wear ""modern"" outfits, they can tan and hang out outside in clothes more revealing than what puritans would allow. They have rock records, makeup, books, they are interested in science. They read magazines and journal and *own* a lot.

Sure, they are not allowed to hang out with boys, but boys are allowed for dinner, even the party at the beginning - surely, it was heavily supervised, but you can see the parents made an *attempt*. They were strict, but Lux still managed to smoke and flirt with boys secretly, hence they were not *that* controlling.

They did allow the girls to go prom at the end of the day. The father was a teacher and took great interest in physics. He was just delighted when Lux won the prom queen.

The parents were strict Christians, but they were not crazy, they were not cult-level puritans like the mother in Carrie lets say. 

What is important though, is that their strictness really fed into the boys™ idea of the girls. They saw them as this unattainable objects of desire, kept in cage, mysterious, innocent. *They never saw them as real human beings*.

Now, Cecilia's suicide. I delved a bit into how the book described Cecilia, and it seems like her push for suicide was that she felt like she didn't belong. She was into nature: talking to her mom about frogs, writing about trees in her journal (which boys™ just skipped cause *boring*). She didn't feel in place at the party, she saw how they treated the kid with Down syndrome. Her tree was set up to get cut, I think she couldn't really connect with her parents either. Her room was full of drawings and models and trinkets. She wears the same white dress she wore for suicide. Her thoughts and trouble were deep, and arguably, the therapist's advice to simply introduce her to more boys was not helpful at all. Like everyone, he attributed her issues solely to the parents' strict parenting style. Society (doctors, therapist) failed to actually see and treat her mental heath issues simply because (just like the boys™) they couldn't see her as her own person.

In the movie, Cecilia was first to go. The boys™ describe how the town reacted to the death, what they said on the news, but never how the sisters reacted to it and how it impacted them. We only see a glimpse of mouring in the movie. And then, they're back to school. ""Like nothing happened"".

One haunting scene is of Bonnie in Cecilia's room when her father sees her. She says ""they took out the fence"". It's clear she was in pain, but it's never delved into.

What's interesting, we don't really see the sisters interacting with other girls in school. We only see a glimpse of Bonnie working on a project with her classmates, and when death is mentioned they turn to her to apologise for bringing it up. It's shallow, it's clear they see them in a similar way to the boys, as something distant. The sisters keep to themselves, the boys lust over them, the school king Trip is into Lux. We can only guess why they couldn't build any meaningful connections with the other girls, or if the boys simply don't notice them. My personal take would be that other girls were jealous, the looks sisters caught at prom were not warm at all.
It would explain further how the sisters ended up in a bubble, all in the same position which made the suicide *pact* a possibility. 

Lux was the most fleshed out character. She was the most desirable, and attainable, for the boys™. She's the biggest ""rebel"", she smokes, listens to rock, flirts. She's a very typical teenage girl but is not seen as such due to her family. She's a ""Lisbon girl"".

With Trip - she genuinely liked him. And honestly it felt like he liked her too at first... However, it becomes clear that he indeed only saw her as a prize and achievement. The reason he left her in the field is because he made it, he took her virginity and it hit him that she is real, that she could do something so ""dirty"" - there was no mystery, she was a teenage girl yearning for love and validation and physical closeness. Trip broke her entirely. She made out with guys on the roof, asking them if they liked her and they didn't even reply. Out of all the sisters, she was the most lusted over by far. She was deeply hurting.

I think the entire prom sequence is crucial. It showcases the *real* Lisbon sisters the most. The way they say ""they're gonna ruffle us out"" when football boys come to pick them up? They feel how guys perceive them and it hurts them. In a car, the 3 older sisters gossip about neighbours, making mean comments, a very shallow conversation which clearly did not fit into the guys vision of them, of pure yet sensual and sophisticated maidens. 

During prom the sisters are awkward, the dances are awkward, that entire interaction with Bonnie and the guy she kissed but didn't like it? *Awkward.* *Normal.*

The guys Trip brought most likely expected them to either be teasing and confident and provocative like Lux (who genuinely felt something for Trip) or graceful angels they made up in their mind. Instead, they were hit with reality. Mary showing how she didn't like the guy she was with, asking not to walk her to the door, Therese (dare I say desperately) asking a guy if he's gonna call her. And he never did.

What Trip did was horrible. As a consequence, it triggered the mother completely. The parents were more or less bearable until their biggest fear became true - their 14? 15? year daughter slept with a guy in middle of the football field, got ditched by him, and had to go back home at dawn in a taxi. It's a traumatic experience for literally anyone.

The mother spiraled, on top of Lux's heartbreak her records got destroyed. The sister were locked inside. There they are - locked in, unable to build any meaningful relationships outside of their own group. The guys don't like the real them. They lost their youngest sister, and it was treated as a show; a tree - their fond memory of her, was going to get cut down. And their protest was about to get treated as a show (the news).

The sisters were suffering, and through all that you have the boys™ watching their every move. Obsessing with them, having their things, but never bothering to actually build any contact with them. Even when the boys™ called, they melancholically played music and never actually talked. It was the sisters who were reaching out.

Remember a scene in school when one of the boys™ tries to talk to Mary and introduces himself? She says ""I know who you are, I've been going to this school my whole life; you don't have to bother to talk to me"".

What drove the sisters to suicide was *dehumanisation* of theirselves.

With parents as theirs, it's hard to connect to them. Usually teens would seek those connection outside, in friends and lovers, but no one would actually give it to the Lisbon sisters. They were different, but at end of the day they shared the same depression.

What if any of those boys took genuine interest and went to dinners with Lisbons and actually tried and held conversations with the family and talked with girls over the phone for example; or wrote letters - anything? What if Trip was respectful and brought Lux home at time? Perhaps the parents would've actually let go even more? What if the sisters had female friends? What if people let them mourn in peace?

They invited the boys to their suicide as a ""fuck you"". And yet the boys™, now men™ still obsess over them the same way.

The line the boys™ say: ""*They never heard us call them from our rooms*"" is infuriating - it was the other way around! It's heartbreaking, and it's truly nails the message of this film.

Lux wasn't even a technically a virgin. But, who cares, right? The title itself communicates the message.",movies

This film got so much praise and is considered a cult classic. It holds an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, 5 Star on Amazon Prime, 7.5 IMDb, etc.. I heard about it as a kid so much because of the game so i decided to finally watch it..  but I don’t get it? I’m a native New Yorker and I’m from the Bronx my whole life. I don’t quite get the hype of all this. Yeah it’s cool to see NY in the 70’s but I could just go to the transit museum and see the same stuff in person. The whole “this really did happen” thing doesn’t change anything for me. It’s just a bad movie lol.

The acting is awkward, really slow, hardly any excitement, everything felt flat, the outfits are cheesy, The fighting scenes look terribly fake and severley exaggerated. I mean these kids beat up groups of people with knives, 2x4’s, guns, and bats  with their bars hands while weighing a whopping 120lbs each.

Cleon dissapears after the whole mix up and no one ever finds him again nor do they care to after the first scene (so much for being a beloved leader), Fox gets tossed into the train tracks and nobody notices or misses him (yes ik he was fired and killed off), apparently neither do the police care because by the time Swan went back to “find the rest” there’s no ambulance outside, EMT’s, or police investigation going on. Guess the cop that tossed him just got up and walked away after committing involuntary manslaughter? Y’know there’s just a dead body split in half on the tracks chilling, that’s regular! 

I mean I know its the 70’s but for crying out loud.

Btw, 60% of the movie is also just them running. Which they do very well, so much so that they can outrun a bus somehow.

Then the final scene at the Beach is this huge BS knife toss to disarm the antagonist who was a nobody with a revolver in the first place. The gun fires before getting dropped but somehow hits nobody within 2 feet of it. Then they turn and are surprised (because their peripheral vision seemed to not exist) to see an army of 100 black guys spectating them as if they couldn’t see them at 5AM in Coney Island.

fcx0l5gc,1c9av8y,1713679791.0,Guy Ritchie's Style,"I'm watching The Gentlemen, the Netflix show produced in 2024 by Guy Ritchie (who shared director responsibilities with 3 other directors). I think the length of the show has allowed him to go into far more detail than before, and it really emphasizes what his shows are about. 

I think the secret is that his shows are comedies. The actual story he's telling is gritty and raw, often some sort of realistic crime, but all of the characters are acting comically, as if to make fun of the entire concept. In other words, you might say he writes action satire.

It's a clever exaggeration, as if to swaggerize whatever it is the characters are doing. If you take it literally, the characters are dumber and it's shallow. If you understand that the characters are not what they appear (they are actually smarter), then you realize it's not a literal show. That's why it's satire. I guess I'm just not too familiar with the fact that hero movies are often satire.

Ok, so I think there's a relationship between swagger and satire. In a satire, you act cool but are dumb, and in a swagger portrayal, you act dumb but are cool. Comedies can do either, or neither as there are many comedy forms. So, I think the Guy Ritchie style is not satire, but swagger.

The essential Guy Ritchie hero reminds me a lot of the James Bond character.",movies

Like a movie can have a percentage close to 100% but be a thoroughly mediocre movie. And other the other hand a movie can be slightly more polarizing but have an amazing average score. Like it could be at 93% with an 8.8/10 average. I'd much rather see that than a 99% movie with a 7/10 average.

Please don't let that stop you from mentioning them!

rnjelwpv,1c98a28,1713670304.0,The Tragedy of Coriolanus Snow (Movie Ver.)," It took me a while to watch the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes after reading the book but I can say I was thoroughly surprised at how good the movie was. It is lacking compared to the book but when looking only at the film I'd give it a solid 8/10.

Now I've seen a lot of people saying how Snow is irredeemable and a villain throughout the entire movie. While this may be true in the books I don't think it is in the film. I know we can't see his thoughts like in the novel so it's hard to see his deeper motivations but the Snow we do see is most definitely not entirely evil. I believe there were 3 main influences for snows eventual descent into ""evil"". While there are 2 main influences which serve as incentives for snow to remain more neutral maybe even ""good"".

The first person that would serve to corrupt Coryo is his grandmother. She was a Classist and believed wholeheartedly that the districts were beneath them. She constantly fueled the power-hungry and conniving side of Snow, telling him if he doesn't use Lucy Gray he'll end up **""dead in the trees, like your father**"". The second and largest influence was without a doubt, Volumnia Gaul. As Head Game maker, she had enviable political power and was essentially the face of Capitol Cruelty. Her methods were violent and inhumane all of which she likely passed on to her star pupil Coriolanus Snow. However, what we see Gaul do in the actual movie is a tad more subtle. As Snow displayed empathy towards Lucy Gray Baird throughout but specifically at the end of the games. Dr. Gaul sees that Snow is falling towards the side of ethics and righteous morality. This angers Gaul as she can see his potential so she has Highbottom expel him from the academy knowing he'll most likely find his was to District 12. After he makes his decision to leave 12, Gaul sees that he has left Lucy Gray behind along with his morality fulfilling her plan all along. She then leaves us with that chilling smile. ""**Welcome home, Snow**"". the Final and most controversial bad influence is none other than Dean Casca Highbottom. The reason I say controversial is because he had the most potential to be a positive role model for Coryo but ends up driving him to become a vicious snake. His hatred towards Coryo stems from how Snows father wronged him back in the day. Now this makes Dean Highbottom cold and cruel to Snow even though he does not deserve this. Potentially giving him the weakest looking tribute or sending him away to District 8 to be ""**an anonymous peacekeeping grunt**"". If Highbottom had simply put aside his feelings towards Crassus he might have seen a brilliant young man who could've helped him stop the games.

Enough about the bad. I mentioned that Snow had 2 positive influences along with his negative ones. The first and closest to him was his cousin Tigris. Tigris during the film attempted to contrast all the negative authorities who corrupted her Coryo. She repeatedly tries to instill in him the fact that people from the districts were people too and seems to directly oppose violence and revenge. When Snow found out about the mentor system Tigris told him to put himself in her shoes and always consoled him when something went wrong. This was in direct opposition to their grandmother and Dr. Gaul. Tigris and Snows relationships serves as symbolism for familial and unconditional love. However this becomes more and more one-sided as their relationship begins to strain towards the end of the movie. we see Tigris go from affectionately calling Snow ""Coryo"" in the beginning to middle sections to her coyly calling him ""Coriolanus"" at the end of the film. Now last but not least lets talk about Snows antithesis and love interest, Lucy Gray Baird. Her and Snow are complete opposites in class status, districts where they live and education and physical abilities. Now, Despite all of this, these two are able to find some common ground. they both care deeply for their families, they've both dealt with adversity and evil and they both end up caring for each other. Lucy Gray is probably the biggest positive influence in Snows life. She shows him what its like to not be a Capitol elite and cares deeply for him even though they just met. While Snow is a little more possessive and obsessive over Lucy Gray in the books I would ***maybe*** call it love in the Movie. Snow is taught compassion by Lucy Gray and he ends up deeply infatuated with her. The reasons I think Snow actually may have loved Lucy Gray include the fact that after Dean Highbottom tells Snow He'll never win the Plinth Prize, he still tries his hardest to help Lucy Gray survive. Along with Lucy Gray being the only one who was able to almost convince Snow to give up his life-long ambition for power. Regardless of all this Lucy Gray was the one who deeply haunted Snow and influenced him the most with him going so far as to marry a woman he hated so he would never be weakened by love like with Lucy Gray Baird. The Lucy and Coryo ending scene was incredibly heartbreaking but well written and meant to be. I personally think Lucy Gray was watching him and when he came out with the gun that was the final straw, the trust they had was gone and smoking, set ablaze by Snows earlier lie about killing his old self. Earlier we got to see that trust is everything to her. ""**Without trust, you might as well be dead to me**"". Paranoia got to the both of them. Although, with Lucy you could say she loved him enough to let him go and become the man *he thinks* he was meant to be.

I don' t see how people can hate Snow throughout the whole movie. Hes been through hell and I can only imagine what that does to you. He is driven to be what he becomes by everyone in his life positive and negative. At the end of the day Snow played a background character to his own descent. Conflicting influences good and evil ripped at him until one side emerged victorious. as Lucy Gray Baird said. ""**People aren**'**t so bad, not really, Its what the world does to them. Like all of us in the arena. I think there's a natural goodness born into us all. You can either cross that line into evil, or not.**""",movies

wdxun,1c976rh,1713666564.0,The best action heroes are the ones that are in over their heads,"I’ve noticed that my favorite actions heroes are ones that really have no idea what they’re doing but improvise and make their way through. Examples that come to mind are Harrison Ford as either Indy or Han, Tom Cruise in MI, and John McLean in the first Die Hard. These characters are often not cool, calm, and collected when people start shooting at them or when they have to jump out of planes. They’re surprised at the situations they find themselves in and apprehensive about what to do, but they do it.  They’re vulnerable but their ability to think and act on the fly is what gets them through. They’re stressed which makes them human, but witty which makes them like-able. Too many action movies think that we want a hero is always knows what do and is never flustered because that’s “cooler”. I find that thinking usually makes the character altogether more forgettable. There are of course exceptions to the always calm hero (Bourne movies), but overall I love it when the film’s action hero is at the end of their rope and kind of freaking out, but still finds a way through that the audience can relate to and appreciate.",movies

56u37dg2,1c96ryj,1713665193.0,Best actor in a role that through no fault of their own was never given a fair chance?,"Recently I watched the Doctor Who TV Movie, and whilst very of its time one thing that absolutely stands out is the great Paul McGann as the eighth Doctor. What’s somewhat shocking to me considering how great McGann is in the role (and he really is fantastic) is that he was never given much of a chance to really play The Doctor for any significant amount of time beyond this movie and a short special a few years ago. The thing though is McGann was the absolute right choice at the wrong possible time. Coming immediately after Sylvester McCoy (by which point the series’ popularity was somewhat diminished) and right before the hiatus that eventually brought us Christopher Eccleston (who I personally think was the best to take on the role), McGann in the TV movie never really had much of a chance. Couple that with how American that TV movie feels (im aware it was made to appeal to the American audience rather than the British) he unfortunately wasn’t going to have much of a chance for long term continuity. This however doesn’t diminish his performance, since he brings all the energy, personality and tragedy to The Doctor that’s required. 

So I’m wondering, who are some other actors who, through absolutely no fault of their own and even give a great performance on screen, were never given a fair chance at the role? 

Edit: I do find it also quite funny that technically McGanns Withnail & I costar Richard E Grant technically did play The Doctor as well during a Red Nose Day comedy special",movies

cg6iha9e,1c91dtt,1713649448.0,Movie Recommendations: Supernatural or Not?,"Hi!

Looking for movie recommendations for movies that may or may not contain supernatural elements. The mystery of the movie may or may not revolve around whether there are supernatural elements or not.

Examples:

>!The Prestige (turns out “magic” is VERY real, despite painstaking storytelling about how “magic” really works) !<

>! The Boy (What seemed like the supernatural was just a real person) !<

>! The Village (seemed supernatural but wasn’t—and then you even second guess THAT) !<

>! Until Dawn (video game) (big reveal that seemingly supernatural elements were a sick joke by one person—only to find out that the supernatural IS real after all!)!<

Whether magic/the supernatural is real or not might not be the point of the movie, but I want to be surprised and/or guessing the entire time.

I had known that the original copy of this movie was only in theaters for a short time before being heavily cut. The cuts are as I’m aware mainly to when he’s breaking into the safe in the opening scene. Most copies don’t show all of the details because apparently criminals were using it as a blueprint to commit theft lol. 

The other cuts are when they’re breaking in for the big LA heist. They show the full breaking into both the building, tapping into the alarm system, all of the drilling involved in where to locate each wire. They show them systematically tap into each alarm- all 4 until they get inside and get the 5th. It’s more thorough and thrilling.

I mean I’ve seen this movie probably 50 times and these are all details I had 100% never seen before. It actually makes it a much better film to me. Felt more Heat-like in that regard with such attention to detail.

Some actors get hyped by Hollywood, put into lots of big projects, and then the audience says, ""Nah.""

Some get a big film and it seems like they'll be the future, but then their star flickers and fades away.



Let's name a few - not to poke fun, just to remember, and maybe check them out again.



I'd pick **Felicity Jones** - She had high profile hits with very different movies, from biopics *The Invisible Wom*an and *The Theory of Everything* to blockbuster action adventure like *Inferno* and *Rogue One*, and was also going to top-line a Spider-Man spin-off until it was cancelled. Since then, by choice or not, she's had quiet dramas *On the Basis of Sex* and *The Last Letter from Your Lover* - but nothing as high-profile as what came before.

And **Kit Harrington**. *Game of Thrones* was obviously huge, and he had leads in historical disaster film *Pompeii* and spy thriller *Spooks: The Greater Good*. But then experimental drama *The Death & Life of John F. Donovan* and Marvel's under-performing *Eternals* put a question mark on things, and he's been buried in an ensemble in HBO/BBC's financial drama *Industry*.



Hopefully, these two, and others like them, can build back their career momentum.

She started out in Theater in London and was directed by Tony Richardson in her early career.

She played an actress in the low-budget '80s slasher ""Curtains"", which is an absolute favorite of mine and deserves to be seen by every aficionado of the genre, giallo in Canada. 

If I recall correctly, my impression was she got caught up in the Canadian film industry in the '70s and '80s, as she was a British export, and Canada was employing a lot of those in their films. The problem, however, was many of those films were tax shelter flicks or low budget, so many weren't great and didn't exactly bring much exposure to talent.

As a result, Samantha Eggar was left in career limbo since many of the Canadian films she did in the 1970s weren't seen by the public at large. 

If you don't know who Samantha Eggar is, do yourself a favor and explore her filmography. You'll find many gems.",movies

Don't get me wrong, the original is definitely the better movie, but I didn't care for any of the characters. Conversely, in Believer, having a daughter of my own caused me to connect with the primary father of the film, and I felt significantly more emotion throughout its run time, which helped me appreciate it for more than just the horror elements.

npzc6so4,1c8uz68,1713632902.0,Jackie Chan's First Strike is great,"I've always loved the original Police Story. The balance between big stunts and martial arts and humour is just great. But the sequels just didn't make an impression. Police Story 3 especially just completely dropped the ball. Like even with the inclusion of Michelle Yeoh, the stop and go plot didn't help its chances. That 20 minute bonkers climax with the helicopter and train wasn't enough to save the film imo.

So yeah, I had low expectations from the beginning. First Strike, on the other hand was just great. The espionage plot kept me just hooked enough to enjoy the action. The number and scale of action sequences is huge.

The first sequence in the ski resort is better than all of the the previous setpieces except maybe the climax of 3. It just gets better from there. Soon Jackie is jumping from window to window of a skyscraper, and by the climax he is fighting bad guys underwater while avoiding sharks. It's just awesome all around.

The comedy has been toned down though, along with the aspects of his personal life. There aren't any dedicated slapstick sections like the telephone sequence in the first one. The humour now is mostly around the fish out of the water situation that Jackie is in when he's being used as a pawn in the illegal nuclear arms dealings.

The film currently holds a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Not that it really matters but a lot of people still look up these aggregate scores when deciding to watch a movie and such a rating can be off-putting. I agree that it's not Police Story anymore because of the espionage storyline but this is one of Jackie Chan's best efforts and as someone who loves his stunt work, this was a blast to watch. One of the best action films of the 90s

1 - why does Anton not kill the motel woman? I’ve seen the theory that he knows he isn’t alone due to the toilet flush, but why not just kill the other person too, seems simple enough. Was it her defiance that spared her? 

2 - Was the officers (his name escapes me) approaching the motel crime scene a symbol of testing fate? Anton is seen in the shadows, but the cop, to my recollection, leaves, which most likely spared his life.  Is everything the officer has done up to that point simply a reminder of how basically “men make plans and God laughs”, in the sense that he will never be able to get ahead of death. 


3 - Does Anton have a principled issue with killing children or does he just not kill those boys because he’s in no shape to do so? 

4 - this is an age old one that’s been debated - was that accountant killed? He asks “do you see me?” And I understand that basically no one sees Anton and lives, I just wonder if he meant it as “you never saw me” (similar to his comment to the two boys) or “is the sky blue?” And the accountant is then killed, and 

5 - what is the - or is there any -  meaning of the two scenes that were paralleled where Llewelyn (?) sees the three boys and gets a jacket, and the later scene with Anton and the car crash? Is this just a symbol of the foolish corruption money causes (the boy wants money for the beer and the other boy scolds him; the two boys begin to bicker over money the boy initially refused to take)?

e7opwsq9,1c8ttwl,1713629891.0,Fantastic Beasts & What went wrong,"As the title hints, in this post I'll post my recap of the film series and why it didn't work and got cancelled.

After the massive, multi billion dollar success of Harry Potter, everyone, literally everyone (fans, Warner Bross, Rowling, etc..), wanted more. More wizards, more of Harry's world, more magic, more everything... and Rowling delivered, or at least tried to.

And indeed after the first Fantastic Beasts movie (Fantastic Beasts & Where to find them), it seemed like another success of the Wizarding World was on the way. The movie was a hit, Harry Potter fans were back at theaters, Harry Potter (and Fantastic Beasts) merchandise exploded again, etc... Rowling planned 4 additional movies, fans were thrilled worldwide... nobody could suspect how quickly it would be forgotten and fall down, and franchise getting cancelled.

But, that's where the first problem (that nobody noticed) appeared. Billions of fans of Harry Potter worldwide are fans of Harry Potter, not fans of the world of Harry Potter... and Fantastic Beasts weren't Harry Potter. They were never going to be. In many ways, they're a different film genre.. with Harry Potter film series being movies about a wizard kid growing up, discovering who he is, and what he's supposed to do. Harry Potter was targeted to kids, and kids alone. 

With FB, Rowling's idea was obviously to tell a story about the big Dumbledore vs Grindelwald war (something billions of fans have been asking for ever since the final book was released), through the eyes and adventures of Newt and Tina. Fantastic Beasts were meant to be more of a romantic comedy, following the story of romantically involved main leads, who deal with the problems they cause, while the big Dumbledore vs Grindelwald conflict loomed in the back. And as such, FB wasn't primarily targeted to kids, it was targeted to young adults most of all. At first it does seem understandable, given the fact that most kids who were growing up obsessed with Harry Potter were young adults now, but the thing is, magic and wands do not really work with young adults as they do with kids... sure, they're all going to go and see the movie, thrilled for more Harry Potter, but they'll need more than that to get hooked to it, and here's where Fantastic Beasts & Where to find them failed imo. Sure it was a nice spin off to Harry Potter, but it failed at getting people hooked up and building it's own franchise.

Another mistake was that the movie was targeted at old Harry Potter fans, not at making new fans. Sure, at first you think how can anything go bigger than Harry Potter, are there really any more fans to be made? And the answer is yes, new generations of kids, that were kids at the time when FB were being released, that weren't born yet at Harry Potter's times... not young adults that already grew up with Harry Potter.

Does this mean that the film series was doomed to failure from the start and there was never any hope? Absolutely not, the movie was a huge success, it just needed to ""work harder"" to build up the franchise, a strong second movie would do that... but that's where things started to go downhill very fast.

Fantastic Beasts, the Crimes of Grindelwald wasn't that good of a movie. The problem was that Rowling took on the writing all by herself, and though she's a brilliant story writer she lacked experience in writing film scripts... and that's what Crimes of Grindelwald ended up being, a good story (in idea) that wasn't executed that well. Rowling tried to tell two stories and practically squeeze in two movies into one. The result was the worst of both worlds. The movie tried to be both Fantastic Beasts 2, centering on Newt and Tina/Jacob and Queeny with their magical beasts, and Crimes of Grindelwald, with Grindelwald's plans, Lestrange family drama, with Leta Lestrange as the main central character. In the end both plots got cut short, we got an undeveloped central character (Leta Lestrange), Newt and Tina's story cut short, all major plots cut short and going nowhere... the movie wasn't well received at all.

Another huge problem for the already damaged franchised was covid. Warner Bros wasn't sure what to do with it even, before, but said, heck let's try to save it with a third film, but covid got in the way. It delayed both filming and release. With fans not hooked up on the franchise, and disappointed with the second film, waiting for the third film sure wasn't good news... many people lost interest in the franchise as a whole already.

Secrets of Dumbledore was a nail in the coffin sadly. Unlike Crimes of Grindelwald, it was executed well, but the story itself just wasn't that good this time. Partly due to constant rewrites caused by covid, caused by actors entering online feuds with Rowling, Warner Bros and Rowling not being sure weather or not it will be the final installment of the franchise... it was received better than Crimes of Grindelwald, but still not good enough.

Secrets of Dumbledore failed at the box office (it did break even and maybe earn some money, but by Harry Potter standards, that's failure), due to people loosing interest in the franchise and the movie not being that good, again, second in a row in a franchise (due to different reasons though) that didn't hook up the fans to begin with... it was clear that after that Warner Bros will cancel the remaining films and move on. The movie did end on a kind of a final note, at least, leaving the story mostly concluded.

Side note: Rowling's online controversies had nothing to do with the franchise's failure imho. The vast majority of people just do not care about what people write on twitter (Rowling or anyone else, with Donald Trump and Elon Maks being maybe, and a huge maybe, the only exceptions).",movies

“Usual Suspects” a film using an urban legend to conceal its plot device.

2. Did he not have a mom??
3. Since he said he wanted to be a puppet again was he built before, cause of the original story
4. Did he not know the dangers, of that carnival, how many dangerous situations did he put himself in??
5. Who came up with the idea of him developing a crush on another puppet?

I love psychological movies. But often when i say that, people advice me to see Sevens, or the Fifth Elements, like thriller.

But this is not what i meant. 

Today i have one move and there is one police interrogation and i love the tension, the dialogue in this interrogation. It doesn't mean necessary to be a thriller. I like when it looks like realistic and when there is no music.

I love for example https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview_(1998_film) with Hugo Weaving.

I don't like when the motivation is to scare.

ojr7uic,1c8qkbo,1713621313.0,I spend more time deciding how to watch films than actually seeing them. Any advice? (read the description)," Let me start by saying that I have a great passion for cinema and therefore I take it very seriously, so I tend to think really hard about what I should watch. 

The problem for which I need advice is not so much that I can't decide which film to see, but that I constantly change my mind on how to decide what to see; it must be said that I am a bit obsessed with lists and therefore I keep changing my mind: first I wanted to see all the films of the most famous actors (after 3 films I changed my mind); then I wanted to see the films based on the year of released in order to make a sort of ranking of the films of that year (after 3 films I changed my mind); then I wanted to see all the films of all the directors of whom I had seen at least one film in order to make a list of directors which I made, taking a lot of hours (after 7/8 films I changed my mind); then I decided to watch films based on genres (after 3 films I changed my mind); then I decided to only see films by directors considered incredible because there is already little time, there are so many films to see and there is no point in seeing stuff that I probably won't like (this period lasted a while but then I realized that I was missing out on a lot of films or directors that perhaps I would have liked much more than the super famous ones considered the best directors, I changed my mind again); at this point I decided to watch films considered masterpieces regardless of the director but even in this case after a few films I changed my mind because I realized that perhaps I was missing out on better films and directors, or that in any case if I never watch bad films I won't I can really appreciate the good ones (and that after having seen a great film by a director I perhaps wanted to see his other films without following the rankings of the best films); then I decided to see all the films of some directors considered the best from first to last to understand how their cinema developed (here too, hours and hours of lists and research and after a few films I changed my mind); then I wanted to try to search for those unknown directors such as Thai or Brazilian and see all their films but after hours of research and lists I changed my mind because finding them was already difficult, even more so finding their films to see; then the desire to make films came back to me ranking by year and then I started again...etc.

 Each of these ideas has made me waste an incredible amount of hours that I willingly spend on the cinema, except that I'm not spending them on the cinema but on deciding what to see. Some of you are surely thinking that I should rather just randomly see a film that I want to see, but that's exactly the problem, since I'm very curious I want to see almost everything and so in the end I end up not seeing anything because I can't choose, so I get an idea on how to choose the films but after a while I change it and so I continue to waste time. 

It may certainly seem stupid to those who see cinema only as simple entertainment, but not to me who see it as a great passion and a great art that must be taken very seriously (obviously I don't mean that it shouldn't entertain).

Have any of you ever had a similar problem? What do you recommend me to do?",movies

\- Harry Potter Did Not inspire kids to want to move into magic, but conversely, inspired the greatest amount of kids into Writing.

I truly doubt a large amount of people grew up wanting to work in state security because of James Bond.  However, I do believe a lot of women grew up watching Clarice Starling (from ""The Silence of the Lambs"") wanting to work in police investigation, but not to a large extent.  Furthermore, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" could've inspired a generation of lawyers.

In regards to Television, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" could've inspired a lot of Baby Boomers to move into Police work.  Also ""Top Gear"" could've inspired a lot of people to move into car engineering.  And ""Grand Designs"" could've inspired a generation of Architects.

mut6n,1c8n5vr,1713610531.0,Are there any other sex/love scenes that are as important to the story as Mulholland Drive?,"Spoilers, yes. 

But I can't recall the use of sex scenes used ingeniously as Lynch did in this film, especially after you piece it together. 

The first one between Betty and Rita is so tender and passionate, but also so deeply tragic. It doesn't feel like Lynch incorporated this scene into the story to get his rocks off. He even digitally blurred Herring's nudity so it wasn't too explicit. 

The second one on the couch is cold, depressing, and clinical, and nothing romantic about it compared to the first one. It just feels desperate and sad. 

Leading then to the masturbation scene with Diane sobbing. her obsession taking over, not even doing it to get off, but trying to distract herself while realizing she'll never be loved or cared for the way she wants to. Then you get those blurry POV shots as her tears fill her eyes. 

None of this is gratuitous or erotic. It's just sad. I'd maybe include Blue Is The Warmest Color, which I love, but the sex in it could have been trimmed down a bit, or Don't Look Now where they make love while it's edited with them getting dressed, and taking a break from the trauma.

Best Thing: Michael Clarke Duncan steals every damn scene he's in as Bear. Just great. (Very close second is the iconic Ben Affleck DVD commentary.)

Worst Thing: The obnoxious way Aerosmith has like 85 songs injected into the film. I don't know if this is fair or not, but at the time it was in theaters (and now) it seemed to cheapen Liv Tyler's performance that Aerosmith was so heavily saran-wrapped all over the film. She had already had several great roles before Armageddon (Empire Records / Stealing Beauty / That Thing You Do), but none of those were super widely seen. Then she's cast in Armageddon, which she definitely earned on the merits, and it would have been fine if there was one Aerosmith song, but the fact that there were like four in-your-face Aerosmith songs seemed to make it an oh-yeah-it's-the-Aerosmith-guy's-daughter thing.  Maybe I'm just resentful because this is the first time I've watched Armageddon since I saw her powerhouse performance in The Leftovers. 

To be clear, I'm fine with Aerosmith's music, some of which is great. It's just so damn gaudy in this film. Ugh. I need more dialogue like ""Independence is off the grid"" and less Aerosmith...",movies

I keep being frozen by this since it doesn't have shockingly new content compared to the prior iterations... and it, you know... removed the central superpowers. So I keep forgetting to ask the person: ""Which Dunes did you read before entering this theater?"" / ""Which Dune films did you watch before this one? Which TV series?""

It's a production of Dune. It's well-produced, updated, and basically intact. But I'm not sure how one comes from the priors and scream hallelujah to the sky for the reign of glory to continue. So I'm just trying to confirm that this ""Dune is the greatest thing ever!"" mantra is generally the result of it also being their introduction to Arrakis. And if so, man-o-man I'd love to be in your shoes and have the books presented to me this way from the start. :)

Oscar Isaac - He feels like a Latino George Clooney on a budget. Isaac was in this awful casino hustler movie but he felt sort of Clooney to me.   
Luis Guzmán - He is the chill Latino supporting actor like John Leguizamo who you are always happy to see in a movie even if their role is small.

for Cars 2: World Grand Prix it will just be all about Lightning in the World Grand Prix. the World Grand  Prix will open with introducing all the cars with Miles Axelrod and we get to see highlights of their racing Careers, we see lighting racing in the piston cup with races we have never seen before, we see some F1 races with Francesco to show off his skill basically we see races with every racer in the World Grand Prix prior to the first race . the first race then happens with some weird things happening like a car crashing for no reason at all. Lighting will still go outside at Maters orders by hearing outside and that results in him losing. he goes back to the Pits yells at Mater and then leaves to talk to reporters. It then has lighting and co reading Mater's note and then it continues with World Grand Prix Stuff. a cool event that happens is we get more than 3 races but the other races are minor. we even see some cars that are there to cheer for cars like we see Strip Weathers in the crowd, Chick Hicks and a bunch of other racers from all sorts of races. the second race happens like in the movie with the crashes but the audience doesn't know what is happening. the final race in London happens and during the race every racer is order to the pits and they get informed that due to complications Miles Axelrod was Arrested for Undisclosed reasons so because of that the World Grand Prix has been put on hold temporality. Lighting reunites with Mater who says to everyone that he is now a knight they don't believe him and  Lighting asks if this is one of his tall tales the movie ends with everyone back in Radiator Springs and Mater has left to do other things. meanwhile the World Grand Prix has been rebranded as the World Race Racing League that any car can join setting up a spinoff franchise involving races in that league. we see a car join the new league a car who claims that his the best car ever named Jackson Storm

for Cars 2: The Great Car Caper it is a spy action movie that sees Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell as a pair of Super Spies that are going after a group of evil cars. during the early days of Tokyo Mater accidently gets involved  when on a tour of something gets caught by an evil car who thinks that there is no way that his attitude is real and believes that he is a spy Holly and Finn Save him and immediately know that he is not a spy they give him a communicator to stay in touch if more villains come after him and go on their way during the first race Mater is kidnapped out of the stall and Finn and Holly save him and tell him to stay outside which he accidently says outside in his mic to lightning. Mater goes back to the pits and Lightning yells at him. Mater Disheartened decides to leave meanwhile the evil cars plot to kidnap Mater in the Airport and a spy contacts Finn and tells him Finn and Holly take Mater into protective Service when he is on his way to the Airport after writing his goodbye note. the Movie has Finn and Holley taking out villains with Mater just there to provide commentary . he does recognize the Big Bad's voice as Axelrod and reveals it to the Queen and then it its announced that the World Grand Prix is postponed by the Head of British Intelligence Mater is Knighted by the Queen and then catches a flight and reunites with McQueen who Mater tries to say he had an adventure but nobody believes him. The movie ends with mater leaving Radiator Springs for good because he has adventures to complete it is sad but it then cuts to mater joining Finn and Holley as a Spy in the World setting up an entire spinoff franchise of Cars involving Spy Movies",movies

5hpq24rk,1c8d33v,1713574440.0,Question about Wind River (2017),"So I recently rewatched Wind River. And it's still incredible. But there was one scene that stood out to me as distinctly different from the first time I watched it. 
During the medical examiner's scene, Elizabeth Olson's performance was more reserved. I feel like I'm going crazy but in the version I watched, she was a lot more passionate and was very shaken by seeing the body. I'm wondering if there were two different versions of this scene and why the director would choose one over the other. I really think the original version I saw adds more to Olson's character by making her seem more naive and out of her depth. Anybody else notice this or is this one of those false memory type things?

EDIT: I might've seen an early cut of the movie because the version I saw definitely didn't show the scene where Bernthal's character saves his gf from the rape. It cuts right from when they notice she's unconscious back to the present and the rape is only implied.

EDIT 2: So apparently I'm not to only person to notice this. The Version I originally saw had Korean subtitles (there are clips on youtube from this version). It also featured all three coyotes being shot and killed by Renner's character in the beginning of the movie. I saw some people saying this was also the version they saw screened at Sundance when the movie was released so turns out I'm not crazy, there are apparently at least 2 cuts of this movie.",movies

Some thoughts:

a. I would say it's a real come back if he made no films at all during his 'quiet' years.

Going by these titles, if you've seen them all, you probably also notice that I do like a good ending, in this case, an ending where the random guy on the street ends up being the winner, sometimes not short term, but they might change laws worldwide long term.

Oh, another one I really liked was ""Hacksaw Ridge"", apparently the directors had to cut out some of the story/scenes, cause it was just ""too unbelievable"". It's normally never like that, it's always the other way around.

War dogs was also pretty great, but on a totally different level, It was dramatized as fuck obviously, but it also showed some stuff that can be verified, so it's at least based on a true story.

i6bon,1ccyvps,1714070315.0,How do you rate movies?,"I've been thinking a lot recently on how I review films and why I give them the ratings I do.

This largely boils down to much weight you put towards enjoyment vs film analysis when rating a movie.

By film analysis, I refer to the standards we hold in regards to what we think a ""good"" film should contain. Not that I think film analysis is objective, but I think there are well established principles in relation to storytelling and cinema that I take seriously, and I apply them when critiquing a movie.

I think one of the most obvious examples of this dilemma is The Room. A film which I think most of us would agree fails on most levels of film analysis, but many get a tremendous amount of enjoyment from. How do you rate that?

The more I document my film scores on sites like letterboxd the more I come around to the position that the worst thing a movie can be is bland.

More like if the hero has an annoying sidekick who keeps insisting they shouldn't do something...but doing that thing would be stupid. Just someone who you're supposed to side against but if you think about it don't or have some reaction of ""This guy is kind of an asshole but he's not wrong.""

So the movie that I always thought of this for was 1408. Samuel L. Jackson has a much more extended role than it needs to be (probably to use him more in promotion) as the manager of the hotel that has the evil room in it. Some of the marketing even kind of implied that he was the villain or evil in some way. But all he does is be really persistent in trying to convince John Cusack's character from not staying in the evil room...and he's not wrong obviously. Like the worst thing you can say about him is that his motives are a bit selfish and he's mostly concerned with the hotel's reputation, but what he wants is better for both the hotel and Cusack. And the worst thing he does is maybe try to outright bribe Cusack from staying there? But that's maybe just a little shady, but it's not even illegal in this context. You only get annoyed with him because if Cusack doesn't stay in the room the movie can't happen, but it makes more sense to not stay there.",movies

Eisenstein changed my perception of cinema. Before I saw cinema as strictly narrative, but now I realize it doesn’t have to be (though Dziga Vertov also influenced this change in mind) 

I hope this post made at least some people want to see his films. If so please don’t start with “Battleship Potemkin.” While that is his most famous film, it’s also his second worst film imo (worst one being Alexander Nevsky) This doesn’t mean its bad, Potemkin is still quite revolutionary, its just not as good as his other films. I think the best way to experience Eisenstein is to watch his films in release order. (He only has 8 films) If you dont have time then I suggest this order: 

1- Strike (1924)
2- October (1927)
3- Ivan the Terrible Part I (1944) (His best film imo)
4- Ivan the Terrible Part II (1947/1958) (It was finished after his death)
5- Que Viva Mexico (There are different versions of this film.Eisenstein shot the footage but never finished editing)
6- General Line / Old and New (1929)
7- Battleship Potemkin (1925)
8- Alexander Nevsky (1938) 

Again all of his films are amazing, so Nevsky is only bad in relation to others.

vr1ei4,1ccjm1t,1714021326.0,What are your thoughts on animation in the West?,"TLDR: 

What have been your experiences in discussions of Animation with others? 

Do you think it is taken seriously in the West? if not, why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Whenever it comes to the discussion of animation, I am noticing very different attitude between people in the West in comparison to the East. This difference also seems more pronounced when looking at America.

The idea being that Animation, especially films, are for children. I don’t see it taken very seriously as a medium for storytelling

On the other end of the spectrum of *“Only for kids”*, there seems to be the attitude that any animation for adults should be black comedy. Popular examples such as; Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Rick and Morty, etc.

But Within the past few years there has been a boom in popular animated series aimed more towards adults which handle more emotionally mature topics and treat the storylines with sincerity rather than having a focus on dark humor; Castlevania, Primal, Cyberpunk, Arcane, Primal, Invincible, Blue Eye Samurai, Hazbin Hotel, Vox Machina, etc. 

Yet, despite the massive success of these series, in recent discussions I have had with others - I still see people who either don’t have any respect for animation as a storytelling medium or just don’t see the possibility of it being more successful if given the chance.

Disney has been remaking all of their classic animated films into live action, and although there are some voices who ask “why?” The films are still box office successes for the most part, or they would not keep making them. However people still ask “Why make live action versions of films that were already great?”

Netflix has recently been remaking popular animated works such as the previously mentioned Cowboy Bebop, One Piece, and Avatar the Last Airbender. All of which triggered various discussions about the artistic value of recreating something into live action when it was already good. 

It just seems like there is this dislike towards animation both in the industry and from audiences. Meanwhile Japan released 76 animated films for Theaters in 2022 alone.

I know it’s apples and oranges to compare the two movies. Yes, the Barbie movie is for families and is Feminism-lite and is a toy movie, but let’s have some fun!

Who the fuck knows what God wants? People kill each other every day and for what? Hm? For politics, for religion, and THEY'RE HEROES! No, no... there's a lot of shit I can't do anymore, but killing's not one of them. And letting those fucking bastards go out and rape someone else isn't either!

Gloria: Is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.

You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood.

But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.

* Day Of The Dead (1985)
* Hardcore Henry
* Natural Born Killers
* Ichi The Killer

There's one particular kill scene in it (won't spoil it but if you've seen the film I'm sure you know which I'm referring to, happening to a particular character at her home) that in just that one scene alone had enough graphic gore and bloodletting for a dozen other films.

Event Horizon came close to making this list as well and if we ever get the original uncut version (which reportedly had a whopping 17 minutes of extra-gory footage excised to avoid an NC-17 rating), I bet it would. Pretty astounding to think 17 whole minutes had to be cut to avoid an NC-17 rating.",movies
sxlv38sl,1ccgh4k,1714011237.0,Movies with a true antihero?,"Not sure why this occurred to me today. Something got me to thinking about movies that might have a true antihero. Maybe my definition is too tight—this is a character that is truly a bad guy. Most movies (and tv shows) really dance around this, generally showing the character with positive traits that make him redeemable, or having him turn around during the course of the movie. 

Dexter (this is tv not movie of course) is a great example of whitewashing the anti hero. The books explored more of the sadistic serial killer side of him. But HBO turned him into more of an almost justified vengeful superhero.

Are there any true antihero movies? Where the main character is just a bad unlikable guy, through and through, all the way to the end?

Edit: lots of great responses! Loved the post on Inglorious Basterds. These were psychopaths sent to do a “good” mission—kill Hitler and end the war. And the did it like the murderous psychopaths they were!  Are there any more like this?

The other was La La Land. Like the film is very touching. But that soundtrack is one of the best that I've heard and I'd have it playing on the regular. The feeling I get is so emotive, so heartfelt. It felt like it amplified and expressed beyond what Emma and Ryan did on a screen

56u37dg2,1ccbo9s,1713997834.0,Best acting in silence?,"A good part of acting tends to come from the voice. Being able to convey emotion, passion, brilliant writing and any number of things is helped exponentially when an actor can speak. However, some of the best acting I’ve found can come when an actor doesn’t have their voice to rely on. Conveying all that emotion and passion with just your face and body is no easy feat, but when it’s pulled off it can be utterly incredible. So what are some of the best times an actor pulled off a scene without uttering a single word?

Of the two examples I have, the first is interesting. Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit already had an incredibly difficult job, acting against something that wasn’t there. But in the scene where Judge Doom reveals what he is, there’s this one shot of Hoskins where he looks utterly terrified and traumatised seeing his brothers killer right in front of him. It’s very quick but it’s such a marvellous moment.

The other is actually from television but is no less fantastic. In the Doctor Who episode Vincent and the Doctor, Tony Curran’s wordless performance as Vincent Van Gogh when they visit the museum of his work at the end is utterly heartbreakingly beautiful. Just seeing Vincent, a man who suffered from extreme depression, self doubt and pain, see his work being not just praised but (through Bill Nighy’s monologue about the impact of his work) held in the highest possible regard, Currans portrayal is just incredible. I cry every time I see the scene, it’s that powerful. ",movies

q77kakky,1ccaxlf,1713995981.0,Exotica 1994 film explained?,"I watched this movie today. I just need some understanding and thoughts about this movie. So from what I got is Francis had a daughter and wife. 


The daughter was murdered by unknown person? But the police thought Francis committed his own daughter murder but was released because they caught the person who actually did it. Local people went into a hunt to find the missing body. This includes Eric, the dj and spokesperson at Exotica club and Christina, the dancer. That’s where they both met and found Francis daughter deceased body. 

The wife of Francis was having an affair with his brother. The guy in the wheelchair. It was confirmed sort of when they got into a car accident. The wife got killed but his brother survived resulting him to be in a wheelchair. 

Furthermore, Francis pays his brother daughter to “babysit” when in reality his daughter is not there anymore. She babysits no one. He likes the rides back with his niece because it brought him that feeling back of when he did it with Christina. 

Overall, I’m just confused

• did francis kill his daughter or not?

• why did Christina end up a dancer? 

• was Francis the biological father of his own “daughter” or  was it his brother? 

• why was the dj Eric, so obsessed with christina? 

• what’s up with the Thomas? He’s a smuggler and gay.

3ta26jz5,1ccasw2,1713995651.0,Challengers. My humble opinion.,"Are we talking about tennis? It's not just a recurring line from the movie. It's basically the whole theme of it. Cuz this movie is always about tennis. It's about tennis when they're actually playing tennis and it's about tennis when they're playing whatever the hell's going on between the three of them.

And, well, I guess you could argue winning at life could go through the same means and towards the same results of winning at tennis: dedication, passion, strength, pride, success, and, the most important one, making the right decisions. And you don't always do. That's the point. This is a drama about three people growing up and trying to achieve all of those, with variable results, of course. Is the resulting story enthralling? I happened to find it quite fascinating, yeah, but you be the judge.

It's undeniably majestically acted by all three of the au pair protagonists and it's a celebration. I mean a celebration of the obsession you could have about playing with a small yellow ball, as well as the one you could feel towards a woman's allure. It's a celebration of the jaw dropping beauty of Zendaya. it's, mostly, a celebration of the beauty of the sport, and that's particularly shown by the fact that it's not shot by playing it safe. It is, instead, a continuous exercise in trying to find the most spectacular way to portray every possible hit of the ball. It reminded me a lot of how the energy of the hits exudes so much from the pages of Happy! by Urasawa (and, now that I think of it, that story is a tennis love triangle too). Many of other shots are good too, the way they're framed is always meaningful of something. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing, albeit sometimes it may be a little overwhelming, I suppose that was deliberate.

One thing to know before you watch: please note that, to fully comprehend all the different nuances explored about the different worlds involved, you gotta look at this film exactly like a coach would observe her player during a match, paying attention to all the small details.

dykew3y6,1cc8s7h,1713990705.0,Ryan's World the Movie (initial review),"Ryan's World is getting a **theatrical** film in August of this year, which is quite late since their newest videos can't even get 70K views in a single day (most channels with over 100K subs do better). It should have came out in 2017-2020 since that's when Ryan's World was at its peak. Some random indie film company is distributing it, which is fine I guess, and it's being screened in over 2,100 theatres across America. Based on what I saw in the trailer, it appears to be a bland and generic film with a mix of boring live action scenes and disappointing animated scenes too. So in the film, it looks like Ryan makes videos on his own (which is a lie because of his greedy parents). The special effects look mediocre and even awful at times (check 0:12 of the trailer).

Then we have the animated scenes. They surprisingly well-animated (with it being produced by the same animation studio as freaking Doraemon), and are probably gonna be the least bad parts of the movie. I like the comic style the backgrounds are going for, everything looks colorful and full of life, and the characters translate well in the anime style. The trailer shows that there's gonna be some action scenes in the film (which is a good sigh of relief since the film is probably gonna be boring filler anyway).

Ryan's parents aren't abusive, but they're greedy narcissists who exploit their three kids (Ryan has two 7-year-old twin sisters named Emma and Kate, who are probably gonna replace the channel when Ryan gets too old). Their videos, despite being done by a production team of 30 people, are poorly-animated ([this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBg58vHVQsM&t=70s) in particular), have bland and incompetent writing, generic characters with no real personality, and are filled to the brim with product placement. They even reuse older videos so they can make the newer videos shorter while padding out the runtime.

This film just proves that Ryan's exploitation is getting somewhat worse, with his sisters now being involved. All Ryan wanted to do was play with some toys on camera back when he was three, but he got popular and his parents took advantage of that).

The film will probably be a box-office flop because nobody watches Ryan's videos anymore. The film may be decent or even good in the most part, despite all the negative stuff I've said about it. I mean don't judge a book by its cover.

2xeoqvj3,1cc6ogd,1713985645.0,One of my all-time favorite films that is rarely available for streaming is now on Amazon Prime: Out of Sight,"[Find it here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/0QX0P4SO3USZV3YA0T40XQOT37/ref=atv_dl_rdr?tag=justus1ktp-20).

For those not in-the-know, *Out of Sight* (1998) by the venerable and honored Steven Soderbergh and is an underappreciated crime flick. It's funny, intriguing, and very, very sexy.

I ignored it when it first came out. At the time George Clooney was still best known as a hunky TV doctor so I didn't have much interest in the watching it. What's more, he's paired opposite Jennifer Lopez who's still best known as a singer, so I skipped the thing.

I finally watched it with my at-the-time housemates when we were doing a Soderbergh marathon and it quickly became one of y all-time favorites.

Clooney is charming as all fuck as the lead character, and his chemistry with J-Lo is pretty amazing. Add Soderbergh's perfectionist direction and a wonderful supporting cast (Ving Rhames, Steve Zhan, Don Cheadle, Albert Brookes, Catherine Keener, Luis Guzman, Nancy Allen, Dennis Farina, and Viola Fucking Davis) and you get a magical thing.

It's based off the book of the same name by Elmore Leonard, and what's a lot of fun is it was in production at roughly the same time that Quentin Tarantino was adapting Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"" as *Jackie Brown*. That film features CIA agent Ray Nicolette as played by Michael Keaton. The novel ""Out of Sight"" also features the character, and in a fun move Miramax allowed Keaton to reprise the role for Universal's *Out of Sight* and — with the urging of Tarantino — let him do it for free. He's great in both.

If you like films about unlikely romance, jailbreaks, bank robberies, carjackings, home invasion, kidnappings, and honestly good jokes, this is a film that you should check out if you haven't fallen in love with it already.

What was the exact reason why Leland left Kane? Was it because he's angry of Kane's affair?

So, a character has a board full of evidence that they’re looking at when they have a major realization. The coffee mug drops from their hand and bounces off the carpet in slow motion. It’s an Easter egg for those who have seen the Usual Suspects, but it doesn’t matter if you haven’t.

I’ve got a leg crossing and uncrossing scene like from Basic Instinct. That’s really old, mind you and might be crossing the line between classic and cliché.

I’ve got people passing round a conch to speak like in Lord of the Flies which is obviously ancient, but I believe they still teach this in school so I’m happy with this.

For TV, I was considering Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. Even if you’ve not watched Breaking Bad there’s a good chance that you’ll recognize the image of two men in yellow Hazmat suits. I’m not sure what the iconic moments of Game of Thrones are, but there will be videos on YouTube.

For movies though, I’ve really not watched many in the last 10 – 15. Wolf of Wall Street is probably the most recent I’ve seen.

Any ideas for iconic movie moments of the last 10 to 15? I’m not looking to take anyone’s ideas, I’m just looking for some suggestions for my research.

It’s just occurred to me that remakes might be worth looking into. One character quotes the remake and an older character quotes the original. Also, it might be funny to poke gentle fun at movies/tv shows that rely on tropes and cliches.

Interested in all suggestions, even stuff that's out-of-the-box.",movies
4gex3629,1cc2pjw,1713976326.0,My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is a masterclass in how to make a terrible movie.,"I couldn't sleep last night. The other day, someone asked me what the worst movie I ever saw was. I know there are worse ones, but this one is definitely the most recent one that stands out in my mind. And ever since, I haven't been able to get it out of my head.

I went to see *My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3* in theaters with my family last fall. The first one had been a staple in my household for over 20 years, endlessly quoted at every dinner. Last summer, we finally watched the second one (several years after it came out), and even though there were some funny parts, it didn't quite match the quality of the first one. Still, it was entertaining enough.

When the third one hit theaters, we decided we wouldn't fall behind, so we went to go see it. What a mistake.

As soon as the opening scene began with the ""family photos"" (really just screenshots from the first two movies in a picture frame slideshow template found on iMovie), I found out everything I needed to know. This was going to be a very, very bad movie.

The next two hours were agonizing and excruciating. I often found my mind wanting to wander, and I fought to pay attention to the movie playing in front of me. Not a laugh was heard throughout the entire theater. I felt like getting up, but I couldn't leave my family there.

Why was it so bad? So many reasons. There were entire scenes with characters on their own, just wandering around the beach aimlessly, with absolutely no effect on the plot or their own character development. I could tell from the actors' facial expressions that they received zero direction apart from, ""Just walk that way and look over there.""

The characters were all isolated (like in the painful final season of *How I Met Your Mother*), and any character that *did* have any sort of dialogue (like the aunt) was a caricature of themselves (I have to give her credit for trying). None of the jokes landed, and sometimes the delivery and timing was so bad that I felt myself physically cringe (squirm) in my seat.

The editing was choppy and off, sometimes cutting away too quickly and other times staying on a scene for several seconds too long. One of the characters (Victory) was endlessly annoying and unrealistic (like imagine if a kindergartener became the mayor of a town and repeated the same catchphrase in every scene). Some plot lines vanished into thin air, and other ones failed to make anyone care.

The whole thing just made me think the movie had been made as an excuse for the cast and crew to go vacation in Greece and, oh, make a movie too on the side. It was very difficult to see how Tom Hanks agreed to produce something like this. It was such a far cry from the first movie.

At the end (finally) when we walked out of the theater, my brother asked me for my honest thoughts. I turned to him and said, ""That may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.""

What other films would you consider to be “a weird tale”? That meaning a story that could be rumored-milled around town, or a campfire. Something that defies explanation and even sometimes exploration.

7zfekqxd,1cbxzz9,1713964756.0,"Knowing the story of the chaotic production of ""Caddyshack"", it's interesting to consider if the film would have been anywhere as good or beloved had it come out as originally intended.","For those who don't know, ""Caddyshack"" was originally supposed to be a somewhat serious/somewhat comedic coming of age story about two recent high school graduates (those being Danny Noonan and Tony D'Annuzio) working at Bushwood Country Club over the summer while trying to figure out their future plans and encountering all sorts of whacky characters in the process. But the production was a mess, fueled by inexperience (many young actors were amateurs and Harold Ramis was a first time director who had to deal with producer meddling), the weather (Hurricane Dave blew through on the first day of shooting) and massive partying/drug use (the shoot was described as ""an 11 week party, legendary even by Hollywood standards""). As such, the resulting footage was a mess, but because the seasoned comedy pros they hired for the supporting characters were good at their jobs, the film gradually morphed into an ensemble comedy abut whacky hijinks at a country club with Danny Noonan still the nominal main character (D'Annuzio however got reduced to supporting character, much to the dismay of his actor), but overshadowed by Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield (the latter two in particular getting much bigger roles than originally planned due to their renowned improvisation skills). As Ramis put it once, they planned on a coming of age film and instead made a Marx Brothers film with Dangerfield in the Groucho role, Chase as Chico, Murray as Harpo and Michael O'Keefe's Danny as the bland Zeppo equivalent. (I guess that analogy makes Knight the Margaret Dumont.) Even the gopher that Murray tangles with was a last minute addition to help tie the plot together. To say the film was a mess was a understatement.

And yet, somehow it all worked, the film was a smash and is an endearing comedy classic. If it had gone right and come out the earnest coming of age story it was intended to be, would it be as beloved as it is? Somehow, I doubt it. Sometimes a happy accident is best with a film's production.",movies

I've lost count where ostensibly violent cinema could see countless dead humans, and people seem unaffected ... ... yet kill or harm a cat, dog or wild animal and it seems to trigger a stronger and angrier reaction. Why is that?  Not trying to argue one or the other but it always seems so odd that we accept violence so reflexively when it's against humans - but respond aggressively if it's against any other animal - even if it's just a prop or dummy.

Why do we reckon that is? What's going on in our brains that causes this worry? Not saying we should see more violence or anything, or judging those who are upset, it just seems like such a strange reaction at first blush.",movies

4s5is,1cbvxme,1713958681.0,The meaning of the American History X subplot,"My wife and I are watching the entirety of the IMDb Top 250 as a fun little movie project. Last night was American History X, which definitely deserves its place on that list.

The thing I find myself thinking about most every time I see this movie is the subplot that basically sandwiches the film.

SPOILERS FOR A QUARTER CENTURY OLD MOVIE AHEAD

One of our two leads, Danny Vinyard (played by Edward Furlong) is a teenager in high school. A white high schooler is taking a beating from three black students for allegedly telling the teacher that Little Henry (played by Jason Bose Smith)--was cheating.

Danny Vinyard exits a bathroom stall, confronts Little Henry who talks a little smack, and Danny responds by taking a long drag off his cigarette and blowing the smoke in his face. Little Henry lets it go because he has to get to class. Danny helps the bullying victim up, telling him he needs to stand up for himself.

As the film concludes, we return to that same bathroom. Danny uses a urinal and in walks Little Henry, this time with a loaded handgun and shoots Danny repeatedly, killing him.

So what's your take on this subplot? The film's other lead, Edward Norton's Derek Vinyard, is the real star and focus of the plot in which he kills two black men seeking some sort of retribution for an incident at a local basketball court. His incarceration changes him significantly, partly seeing fellow neo Nazi skinheads in prison not having any real ideals they stick to, befriending a black inmate (Lamont played by Guy Torry), and his continued friendship and support from Dr. Bob Sweeny (played by Avery Brooks).

Derek gets through to his younger brother Danny and helps realize all the hate and propaganda is bullshit and fuel for angry youths who aren't actually doing anything to improve their or anyone else's situation; they're just lashing out stupidly.

Derek and Danny tear down all the Nazi propaganda and iconography and seem to be headed down a new path, all for Danny to get killed over something that didn't really seem to have anything to do with race to begin with.

So then I can't help wondering... is Derek going to go back to the way he was? His father planted the seeds of racism, his father's murder radicalized him, and then Cameron (played by Stacy Keach) turned him into the Nazi thug.

Is the film suggesting this fairly maleable character is going to turn back to his Nazi ways since his brother was murdered by a black teen, or is ""What did I do?"" as he's holding his brother's body implying he's taking responsibility? That he's not blaming others anymore?

But then... how is this his fault? Aside from Danny being white and Little Henry being black, race doesn't seem to be a factor. Yes, Danny blew smoke in Henry's face, but Henry was bullying a kid and maybe Danny would've done the same thing to a white bully. It didn't really seem like the bullying nor the smoke blowing were necessarily a racist thing either way.

I'd be interested in reading other people's thoughts on this subplot or even just how people feel about it.

fm64x,1cbroqq,1713941328.0,The Devil Wears Prada - So Many People Missed the Point,"I recently watched the Cinema Therapy episode where they discuss this movie and I made the egregious mistake of going to the comments section. Many of the top-liked comments were to the extent that the friends were horrible and that Nate (the boyfriend) in specific wasn't supportive.

Don't get me wrong - in my mid-to-late 20s, I was all about that. I was so sure that they sucked and Andy was ultimately the victim. Some years later, I see how wrong I was, and I think we really need to discuss that, as a lot of people are demanding accountability (from fictional characters) while displaying none.

Hard Truth: If you think that Nate wasn't supportive enough of Andy and her ""career"" (more on that later), you're as bad as Miranda Priestly.

Where to begin? First and foremost, the movie takes place over several months; almost a year, in fact. Nate and Andy broke up a few weeks before Paris, which means he actually endured her job for almost a whole year. That's not nothing; that's a significant amount of time, especially if you're watching a relationship deteriorate.

Second, it wasn't her career. It was a job. She didn't want to work at Runway. She didn't want to work in fashion. She wanted to be a journalist, which, as her father pointed out, she wasn't even doing. She didn't get to write articles. She made connections in the fashion world, but none of them seemed interested in advancing her career in journalism. The closest was Christian Thompson, and even he was more interested in pursuing a romance with her than seeing her as a journalist. Her time at Runway isn't even what gets her her next job. The interviewer even regards it as a blip. Her resume was already impressive enough, so that job did nothing for her.

Third, a relationship involves two people. Nate was initially supportive because he understood why Andy was doing it - an ends to a means. As the movie progressed, though, it became very clear to everyone (but Andy) that she was compromising herself for a job that she didn't want in an industry she doesn't care about. And, as time went on, she expected Nate to go along with it. People say he wasn't supportive, but what they mean is he wasn't passive. In the Age of Girlboss Feminism, everyone else is expected to take a backseat to a woman's career/job goals (and to be okay with it) or run the risk of being canceled by Tiktok/Twitter/Tumblr/etc. A certain artist who recently released an album is the peak example of this narrative. Nate wasn't asked if he was okay with it. People often quip that he should have talked to her about it. When? I know it's incredibly subtle and gets lost in subtext, but Miranda was an overbearing boss who monopolized every free minute of Andy's life. And Andy let her. She couldn't even break up with Nate properly, for crying out loud. When was Nate supposed to talk to her? He was the last person in her life to find out she was going to Paris for a week, so it doesn't seem like Andy was making communication a priority.

The fact is, Andy changed who she was to fit in. Nigel even told her to quit if she didn't want the job. She said no. And it wasn't because she was worried about being blacklisted (again, the hiring manager at the end clearly wasn't bothered by Miranda's praise) or missing out on great career opportunities. She simply remarked that it wasn't fair. She had something to prove. I get that, but if you're trying to prove your worth to someone who clearly doesn't see it or value it, you're a lost cause. I just don't see how so many people are quick to call out Grease because Sandy changed for Danny, but don't realize that in The Devil Wears Prada Andy changed for Miranda.

Was Nate perfect? No. Nobody in this movie was. Is Internet culture taking a narrative and distorting it to prove a narrative that doesn't really exist? (That Nate and the friends are the real villains?) Yes.

  
ETA: Expecting Nate to stand by Andy is like expecting Steven (Stephen?) to stand by Miranda. That's not how relationships work.",movies

55o7t,1cbpfl8,1713932956.0,Mighty Ducks 3 displays a fundamentally good thematic manner of ending a story that few franchises follow,"One thing that always makes me roll my eyes is the escalation of stakes as franchise progress. You thought the first baddie was hard because he was a world destroyer? Well the villain of #2 is a *galaxy* destroyer. Mighty Ducks 2 raised the stakes in a semi-believable manner that was still slightly corny. Mighty Ducks 3 kind of does the opposite and works great.

What makes it great is the stakes are low. It's not about taking on some mustache-twirling villains for gold medals. The climax is simply a game for pride. The core story has nothing to do with the Varsity team, it simply revolves around Charlie and his journey to learn real leadership. From not taking responsibility for committing turnovers early on, he gives one of my favorite quotes in the later act (paraphrasing): Connie: they're giving it to us pretty hard, what do we do? Charlie: we gotta buckle down, play a little defense. I know it's an actor reading a line but I love it so much. I always tell guys I play pickup ball with to always have a next-play mentality. Forget everything, your only responsibility this very moment is to get a defensive stop.

I'm so glad Ducks 3 went in this direction instead of making it be about versus galaxy champions. I know it's like critically panned but I at least think the moral is very good considering the incoming audience was people growing up on Ducks 1 and 2. Like yeah, scoring fancy goals and winning games against artificially evil bad guys is fun, but ultimately being a good teammate, person, and leader is what's most important.",movies

gg4h6,1cblom4,1713921379.0,"Movies that have gotten ""worse"" over time through no fault of their own?","I'm not talking about movies that are dated or aged poorly. I'm talking more along the lines of stuff feeling cliched even though it was novel/unique when it came out, something being referenced to death in the zeitgeist so that it just doesn't feel special anymore, or things of that nature.

This post is inspired by a recent rewatch of Robin Hood Men in Tights, which was almost unwatchable at times (hear me out before you down vote me on principle). I hadn't seen it since I was a kid and remembered liking it a lot. This recent rewatch wasn't great because so many of the jokes fall into these three categories:

(1) meta humor/winking at the camera. In 1993 this would have been a lot more unique but in today's post Office, post Deadpool, and post MCU world, having characters look directly at the camera to comment on how weird something is is just so overblown.

(2) direct references. It makes sense that a spoof movie would have references but they just aren't relevant anymore. ""Unlike other Robin Hoods I have an English accent"" makes zero sense for a modern audience because very few people remember or care about that movie. Ironically I feel like Men in Tights had a larger cultural impact than the Robin Hood movie it's comparing itself to.

(3) The best jokes have been quoted to death. This might be unique to me but I've heard so many of the best jokes in this movie quoted out of context so many times that they just weren't that funny hearing them in context. Your response to a joke is supposed to be laughter, not ""oh, that's where my buddy got that from.""

Again, none of this is the movie's fault and I'm super bummed I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did as a kid. Unlike other movies that I could say the same about, I don't think that it doesn't hold up because it's actually secretly been bad and nobody noticed at the time, I think it's because it has a lot of overused tropes that weren't overused tropes at the time and references to it have outlived the things that it references. Despite that there was still a ton I liked and even parts I laughed at because Mel Brooks is great but now I'm wondering what are some similar examples where a movie just doesn't hit the same because the world around it has changed and made it hit differently?",movies

This is either a word or a phrase, I’m not sure which. This is a stereotype of a person, in the way that when you hear the word “frat boy” or “office drone” or “horse girl” or paints a picture in your head of a type of person.

---

I’m looking for the word/phrase or trope that means a person who is just different for no real reason, in a way that usually doesn’t make any sense and often doesn't drive the plot in any serious way. It’s not something they’re trying to be, it’s just a fact of their character. Usually there’s a creative or artistic element to it. It's almost always a one-dimensional character with no real personality other than being ""different."" 

It’s very, very similar to “Manic Pixie Dreamgirl” but more masculine. It’s like the kind of guy who hangs out at record stores and buys his clothes at the Salvation Army. There’s one of these guys in every coming of age movie, sometimes as the main character, sometimes as the “wise man/wise woman” who ushers the main character into adulthood.

Examples of “different guys” (or girls) from media:

* Harold from *Harold & Maude*
* The main character from *Perks of Being A Wallflower*
* The main character from *It’s Kind of A Funny Story*
* Dash from *Dash and Lilly*
* The love interest (I'm blanking on her name) from *Foxfire*
* Holden Caulfield from *Catcher In The Rye*
* Stargirl from the *Stargirl* books
* Gus from *The Fault In Our Stars*
* Anti from *Mixtape*
* Tobin from *Let It Snow*
* Jess from *Gilmore Girls*
* On that note, Kovu from *The Lion King*
* Ian from *Shameless* is kind of a satire of this trope by taking it to the extreme
* Holden Marsh from *Law and Order: SVU* also pokes fun at this trope in a very dark way
* Jimmy from *Quadrophenia* tries to be this trope, but ends up becoming a Hipster by accident
* Michael Cera plays this trope in almost every movie he stars in

My only exposure to *Boy Kills World* was a trailer I had seen a few weeks back and frankly, I wasn't really all that interested in seeing it. But, when the movie started playing, I figured I'd give it a fair shot since I was already in the theater at that point.

# Warning: Spoilers ahead!

>!High-level overview is that the audience is introduced to a dystopian world ruled by a totalitarian familial dictatorship, and remains in power through the use of brutal force and theatrics of public execution of dissidents on live TV, called ""The Culling"". The protagonist known as and referred to as The Boy are played by the brothers Cameron and Nicolas Crovetti, and the adult version played by Bill Skarsgard. Oh yeah, and since The Boy is a deaf-mute (due to a montage of explanatory torture imagery), his ""inner voice"" / lazy exposition explainer is played by H. Jon Benjamin.!<

>!All this tees-up a revenge plot as thin as Skarsgard's wiry frame.!<

>!The characters The Boy meets along the way are either parodies of one-dimensional side-kicks, B-plot villains, and field-bosses, or are just one-dimensional side kicks, B-plot villains, and field-bosses.!<

>!Fight scenes are meant to bedazzle and try to pay homage to ultra violent, highly stylized grindehouse flicks, samurai films, and kung-fu cinema, but ends up being a 13-year old's poor attempt to rip-off Tarantino's *Kill Bill* duology. In fact, one of the most prominent problems with *Boy Kills World* is its pacing, which becomes fatiguing and exhaustive in its quest for blood, gory violence. Worst of all, it becomes boring.!<

>!Even the film's attempt to reveal some plot twists fall short of making this movie engaging. The helmeted female field-boss? Yup, it's The Boy's sister. The matriarch dictator? Yup, the Boy's mom. The Shaman who trained The Boy to avenge his family? Yup, he was really the bad guy using The Boy for his own revenge.!<

>!Very rarely does the script make good use of H. Jon Benjamin's voice acting. And perhaps it's just the over-exposure of Benjamin's voice with years of voicing highly recognizable and beloved characters such as Coach McGuirk, Ben Katz, Sterling Archer, and Bob Belcher.!<

>!The only brilliant moments are when the movie acknowledges that The Boy is deaf (and this movie at times forgets that), and is unable to decipher one side-character's lips and the audience gets to be cued in to what The Boy humorously and erroneously thinks the side-character is saying.!<

I feel like it is criminally underrated. Every time I watch it I literally think on it for the next few days. A small percentage of it could possibly be because the setting of the movie sort of reminds me of the area where I grew up and still reside to this day, but still.

The cast is stellar, especially Woody Harrelson. He absolutely crushed that role. I read on IMDB that after shooting wrapped, he walked up to the director and gave him a hug and told him that he had never been happier to shed a character in his entire career like he was with that one. Him, Bale, Casey Affleck, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, Sam Shepard… come on.

smuxt9qne,1cbfsnu,1713906011.0,Jaws questions?,"i've always wondered these things about Jaws (one of my all-time fave movies):

&#x200B;

\- why are people going wearing sweaters and jackets? when Hooper arrives, why is he wearing a black wool knit winter cap? why is Quint wearing a military field coat? isn't it almost July?

&#x200B;

\- how does Ben Gardner's boat have a huge hole in the hull, but it hasn't sunk? and how did his head get way down into the ship's hold? why would he be *in* the ship's hold, and wouldn't Bruce have to get inside there with him in to bite off everything and leave his head behind?

&#x200B;

\- why are guys throwing dynamite and fireworks overboard during the shark hunt? is it to attract the shark, or are they throwing around explosives blindly hoping one will hit Bruce?

&#x200B;

\- my favorite line in the movie: ""a whuuuut?"" but how do two veteran fisherman, who almost definitely grew up near the water, not know what a tiger shark is?

&#x200B;

\- who the hell are all the guys posing for the newspaper picture? Hendricks and Brody are local cops, fine...and the two guys who hooked the tiger shark are in it....but who are the other 10-15 dudes standing in the shot?

&#x200B;

\- why are there 50 guys with hunting rifles deputed to patrol/protect the beach? is that how they do it? a shark shows up and they give it the Bonnie and Clyde treatment, pumping it full of lead, even though the water is full of swimmers and the beach is packed with vacationers?

&#x200B;

\- what's up with those crazy nurse caps in the hospital? i grew up in the 80s, and i've never seen anything remotely like those caps in person or anywhere on google.

&#x200B;

\- why is Quint shown boiling shark jaws? wouldn't shark jaws dissolve in boiling water, leaving nothing but the teeth? is he using the teeth for mounting purposes (like the taxidermied jaws in his shack)?

&#x200B;

\- why is the Orca built so you have to clamber across the slippery port side gunwale to reach the forecastle (forward)? isn't that extremely dangerous? are any ships really built this way?

&#x200B;

\- aboard the Orca, Hooper says the distant sound is a whale call. does anyone know what whale it's supposed to be? i've only heard whale calls that are deep booming bass and squeaks and clicks. and how could you hear whale calls *above* water?

&#x200B;

\- at first, Hooper seems super stoked about encountering this one-of-a-kind shark. he even tags it for tracking later (i'm guessing by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute). shortly after, he seems intent on killing it by sticking it with a spike syringe loaded with cyanide. what gives?

&#x200B;

The movie's premise is very similar to a BBC ghost hunting show, where they investigate a haunted house for paranormal activity. Here's the fun fact: the BBC actually aired it as a real show on Halloween night! (They only hinted at it being scripted at the very beginning.) Apparently, many viewers thought it was real, and it freaked a lot of people out!
The reviewer praised the movie for its realistic portrayal of how people would react in such a situation, something they rarely see in horror films. I completely agree - there's no unnecessary drama, and the characters behave very realistically.  This is definitely a rare gem in the horror genre!
Even though I haven't seen ""Late Night With the Devil"" yet, I think I might have already seen the superior film with this BBC ghost hunting mockumentary.

Context:

> Le Pacte is a French motion picture company headquartered in Paris. It specializes in film distribution, co-productions and international sales. It was founded by Jean Labadie in November 2007, shortly after he was forced out of his previous company, BAC Films. Since its creation, it has become one of the largest independent French distribution companies. It had a record number of admissions in 2019 with more than 6.5 million cumulative admissions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Pacte

----

> **Coppola's ""Megalopolis"" to be distributed in France by Le Pacte**

> Philippe Guedj

> The suspense is over: just as speculation was running wild over the distribution of Megalopolis, the high-risk sci-fi blockbuster presented by director Francis Ford Coppola at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival, Le Point Pop learns from sources close to the matter that the independent company Le Pacte will obtain exclusive distribution rights for the film in French cinemas. ""It's going to be a real sport,"" says a film professional, referring to the uncertain commercial potential of the 26th feature from one of Hollywood's greatest living directors. In accordance with the filmmaker's wishes, however, this extraordinary work will indeed be seen on the big screen in France.


> Scheduled for release in multiplexes in France at the end of September, Megalopolis is said to have cost between $120 and $130 million. The screenplay, which Coppola has been working on for four decades, focuses on the struggle for influence between two men involved in rebuilding a major American megalopolis (New York?) after a cataclysm in the near future. The two rivals are a visionary architect (played by Adam Driver), with ambitions for a city based on ecologically virtuous growth, and the city's mayor (Giancarlo Esposito), the embodiment of an old world with corrupt methods.

> Self-financed by the director of The Godfather, who had to do without the support of a major studio for this kamikaze adventure, Megalopolis will be screened in competition on the Croisette, surrounded by a double aura of excitement and mistrust - the most skeptical fear a pensum of over two hours that risks scaring off the crowds with its excessive rejection of convention. Founder and president of Le Pacte, after having created other renowned companies such as BAC, Mars and Wild Side, Jean Labadie boasts an impressive track record of demanding, often commercially risky, French and international feature films.

> Among other titles, Le Pacte has distributed in France such works as Drive, Snowpiercer, Timbuktu, Les Misérables, Roubaix, une lumière, Dark Waters, La Syndicaliste, Jeanne du Barry and, more recently, the phenomenal Anatomy of a Fall and Borgo. We can imagine that Le Pacte's cash flow, recently galvanized by the box office and worldwide sales of Justine Triet's Palme d'Or, has put the company in pole position in negotiations with Coppola.

Joe Pesci was the comic relief in Lethal Weapon. 

Sly Stalone was the tough guy and Rob Schneider the ridiculous jackass. 

Even Will Smith was the tough guy in Independence day and we had numerous other comic reliefs, including the psycho redneck and Data.

So what's the opposite of that? Wherein otherwise competent protagonist(s) suffer repeated unexplained bursts of incompetence, fundamental skills lapse, or forget they can do certain things, for the sole purpose of allowing the plot to move along.

Edit to clarify: I’m not talking about “character dies quickly-easily” like a Redshirt, or “character does stupid things” (white people in any haunted-house movie). I’m talking about when a character *whose competence has already been established* suddenly turns dumb strictly because otherwise the story would be over in the first act.  

I finally got around to watching the first season of *Jack Ryan* on Amazon and it occurred to me that every single element of the Big Bad's plot succeeding completely hinges upon the utter incompetence of hundreds of professionals from dozens of US agencies, including them making inexplicably dumb decisions that are actually significantly harder than other choices they had available to them (never mind what they'd actually do IRL). If any one of them had said, ""Hey wait, maybe we shouldn't do that, because it's stupid,"" the plot screeches to a halt.

Maybe another example is the recent *Top Gun* sequel. Instead of using B-2 stealth bombers with bunker-busting weapons specifically designed for targets exactly like the one in question...or even using the whole Navy carrier air wing that is right there on the ship with them, including aircraft whose entire purpose is to jam and attack SAMs and their guidance radars...they instead go with a bare-bones strike package which has statistically no chance of success and will get absolutely clobbered with missiles...because it looks cooler.",movies

Today someone who's regarded among the top 5 greatest American, or in general, actors of all time turns 87 years old.

I think Jack Nicholson may have the best filmography ever in cinema history.

I mean, it's so diverse and eclectic, maybe even generally better than DeNiro who, despite considering him the superior actor and with more masterpieces and highs, occasionally may have returned too much to the organized crime genre.

7dezl,1cb0r9k,1713866511.0,The Beast and Lea Seydeoux,"The Beast was a minor disappointment. 

I was told by more than a few theater owners that the beast was going to be one of the best art house movies of the year if not the last couple of years. Personally, I was let down one of the that the beast was going to be one of the best art house movies of the year if not the last couple of years. 

Personally, I was let down one of the biggest reasons for this was the acting by Lea Seydoux and George McKay. biggest reasons for this was the acting by Leo and McKay.

There’s just some thing about Seydoux that I can’t pinpoint. I don’t know if it’s just her acting, which I actually find kind of bad or if it’s something else.  she seemed like she was in a remedial acting class. I *could tell* she was acting if that makes sense, it’s not a good thing either way.

It’s just something about her responses to questions in the scene. She seems like she’s overthinking things or *thinking” about acting abd she’ll respond… by acting. She seems like she’s acting and trying to figure out choices in real time and being totally un natural. 

For a minute, I thought this was supposed to be something related to the character in the film itself but no, I think she’s just a shit actor. she *is* a shit actor. There is something off about her. 

I can’t comprehend why she’s such a big star when there are better actors in a community college acting class. Hell,  I’ve seen better acting in high school plays… George McKay on the other hand…. 

McKay just fucking sucks. Something about his dead eyes, just a weird looking dude, almost stereotypical lesbian looking in some aspects. I did not buy him for a second in this role. 

The film itself was OK. There should’ve been another story added, and one of the story should’ve been cut by a lot. I’m not gonna spoil anything, but you’ll see when you get there as it gets to become a little tedious. Films an exercise in patience.

Oh, it was nice tray. I enjoy some good fun science fiction and this had all the ingredients to be become something classic it just wasn’t. It was a poor shit action Oh, it was nice tray. 

I enjoy some good fun science fiction and this had all the ingredients to be become something classic and it just wasn’t. It was a poor shit acting class full of hacks and overhyped “stars.” 

Seriously can someone explain to me why Seydoux is such a famous person and why they keep casting her and please, I’ll wait for you to explain the same thing for George McKay.

mx9u8,1cazorh,1713862102.0,I've completely fallen in love with 4:3 / 1.33 aspect ratio in films,"I have no idea why or how or even when it happened, but I noticed recently just how much I absolutely adore 1.33 and 1.37 aspect ratios. Zack Snyder's Justice League, Grand Budhapest Hotel, I've Been Thinking of Ending Things... 

I can't fully put into words why I love it so much. I think it's because it gives me a feeling of looking through a window into the worlds on screen, but maybe more importantly is the feeling of symmetry, and the feeling of looking at a wall painting that is alive. With the square format, I feel that no space is wasted in the frame. Symmetry in the image becomes even more powerful since the frame itself is square. Big things, like buildings, strong characters, etc. feel somehow even more powerful when the space is so crammed compared to 16:9 or scope. Composition of elements in the frame feel almost naturally pleasant and fitting, because, again, there's almost no dead/empty space so all the space compliments other elements so well. It also feels very portrait-y, again almost like a wall picture coming to life, due to the boxed-in format. And of course, it feels very vintage and nostalgic.

I adore this aspect ratio! What are your thoughts on 4:3 and 1.37 in films?",movies

A lot of modern horror movies tend to portray characters as being unrelentingly miserable and dower in a way that's almost becoming cartoonish. They hang out in shadows and everything looks as bleak as possible. They look like they're about to perform a tracheotomy on a baby no matter what they're actually doing. It's almost starting to detract from the movies' impact on me.

Horror comedies are becoming more enjoyable to me because they're not relying so heavily on being miserable. One thing I've always liked about The Host (2006) is the creature attacks happening in places like happy, sunny parks.

hei1i93s,1cauiwo,1713842606.0,Ending to Poor Things (2023),"I finally got around to watching Poor Things over the weekend, and I absolutely loved it! From its meticulous attention to detail, from the exquisite cinematography to the intricate costume and set design. Moreover, the stellar performances from the cast added depth and authenticity to the narrative. Yorgos just don’t miss! However, I can't help but feel conflicted about its ending.

Throughout the journey of Bella Baxter, we witness her transformation not only intellectually but also emotionally. Despite encountering the darkest facets of humanity, Bella remains a beacon of hope and optimism, believing in the potential for redemption and understanding. Her compassionate nature and caring heart shine through, even in the face of adversity.

Yet, the ending of the film seems to diverge sharply from Bella's established character arc. When she subjects Alfie to a brain transplant with that of a goat. This to me feels jarringly inconsistent with her beliefs and growth throughout the film. While Alfie's actions were undeniably heinous, Bella's decision to condemn him to a life of crawling on all fours and consuming grass(as fucking hilarious as it was) seems to contradict her overarching message of compassion and forgiveness.

What's particularly perplexing is Bella's own criticism of Max and Godwin for their actions towards Felicity, which she perceives as morally reprehensible. Yet, in a twist of irony, Bella herself ends up committing a similar act, albeit in a more extreme fashion. While her actions at Alfie's manor we’re obvious self-defense, her subsequent choice to subject him to a fate worse than death raised questions for me about her character's integrity and the consistency of her moral compass.

Given that Alfie would stop at nothing to have Bella, or “Victoria” back it does make sense why they can’t let him leave. He essentially claimed Bella as his property and refused to let her go. I can understand why drastic actions needed to be taken, I just can’t help but feel conflicted. Perhaps this was her way of taking Harry’s lessons to heart, about accepting the harsh truths in life and using it to protect you. What did you guys think of the ending and the film overall?",movies

q2kftd3j,1cahvjq,1713809643.0,Why is Rosemary’s Baby such a beloved film? (Spoilers),"I wanted to love it so bad, but I ultimately gave it 1.5/5 stars on LetterBoxd. I may have misunderstood something, but the rape and misogyny in this movie were so disturbing, and I was hoping that Rosemary would rise above it all like it seems like she’s painfully building up to do in the movie, and then in the end, she suddenly is so overtaken by maternal instinct that every other feeling she has is just swept away? It was such a slap in the face. It was visually striking, and I thought it had a great score, but overall it just felt so lackluster. Then when I found out the director raped a 13 year old after I finished the movie, it just made my disgust so much deeper. I’m normally one to separate art from artist, but I can’t help but believe he made this movie out of a sick fantasy he had, and somehow it’s beloved and the top rated horror movie on IMDb. So disappointing. 

Edit: I want to explain that I am usually a fan of uncomfortable narrative with tragic endings. That is not my problem with this film. I just don’t understand how her mindset did a literal 180 within seconds at the end of the movie, and what made that happen. If she loved the baby more than her negative feelings about the situation, why wouldn’t she have felt that way since the beginning? I just feel like this ending was stuck on for shock value and that was it, and it makes her mindset throughout the entire movie leading up to it feel so disingenuous.

*A high school teacher's experiment to demonstrate to his students what life is like under a dictatorship spins horribly out of control when he forms a social unit with a life of its own.*

High school teacher, Rainer Wegner, may be popular with the students, but he's also unorthodox. He's forced to teach Autocracy for the school's project week. He's less than enthusiastic at first, but the response of the students is surprising to say the least.

But old movies also made predictions about society's future, and often they missed the mark by quite a bit. They often assumed that social mores and gender roles would remain the same in the future. They assumed that the political status quo of the time would endure, portraying futures where the Soviet Union would endure into the 21st century, or where Japan overtook America as the world's economic superpower. And amusingly, they often assumed that the fashions and hairstyles of the time would remain fashionable in the future.

-WHY does a movie have alternate (or more) endings?

-Maybe the movie producer tries to ""please"" audience with different preferences.

According to WIKIPEDIA, the two different endings are as follows.

**version1:**

As the Darkseekers attack the lab, discovering the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as the Darkseeker alpha male rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured, and gives it to Anna, before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then kills both himself and the attacking Darkseekers with a grenade, saving the cure.

The following day, Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors' camp in Bethel, where they are greeted by military officers and other survivors before Anna hands them the cure. Anna narrates how Neville's efforts and sacrifices to save humanity ultimately became legend.

**version2:**

As the Darkseekers attack the lab, the alpha male Darkseeker creates a butterfly shape while attempting to break through the glass to the laboratory. Neville realizes it is referencing the butterfly-shaped tattoo on the female Darkseeker's neck and the alpha male and his followers have simply been trying to recover his mate. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down and Neville apologizes after seeing the latter emotionally respond to his mate's return. The alpha male departs with the rest of the pack. Once they are gone, a shocked Neville looks over at the many pictures of his test subjects and realizes he has become a monster in the eyes of the infected, showing remorse for the experiments he has undertaken over the years.

The next morning, Neville abandons his research and heads along with Anna and Ethan to Vermont as a changed man, in the hope of finding the survivors' colony. They cross the George Washington Bridge, while Anna delivers a hopeful monologue ending with the statement: ""You are not alone.""

4s5is,1ca9jxd,1713789194.0,Would Léon: The Professional be better without the subplot of Mathilda falling in love with Léon?,"Although generally well liked by critics and audiences, the one glaring and uncomfortable aspect of Léon is the subplot of a 12-year-old girl falling in love with her hitman guardian and mentor, Léon. 

Although the movie thankfully spares the audience of actually ""going there"" with Léon steadfast in refusing Mathilda's advances, it's undoubtedly uncomfortable for viewers.

Aside from Mathilda's misguided affections, there's also the little dress up and performances where she sings Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" and the JFK/Marilyn Monroe ""happy birthday"" routine. 

So the question is, does any of this add value to the film or could have all been simply cut out without any real impact to the narrative?

tn0g5ayx8,1ca85ev,1713784857.0,"Memento - specific theory, detailed description","I have a specific theory about Nolan's Memento that I feel strongly about, for which I think there is the strongest evidence, and which I think is interesting. To explain it briefly, I will write it assuming people know the basic ideas of the movie plot and focus on my theory of what happened with the story that wasn't presented on the screen.

So my main part of the theory is that I think Teddy had something to do with Leonard before we saw him on the screen. I mean even before those black-and-white scenes, and further. As he mentioned himself, he may have been assigned as a policeman to that case where Leonard got the brain damage. He may have also only heard about it from other policemen he worked with, but to go further, and the thing that I think is more important, I actually think he may have also had something to do with breaking into Leonard's house, directly or not. The reason for it is that, first, we know he's a corrupt cop dealing with drugs and has no problem with harming others, not to mention his deceitfulness, which we learn all through the movie. The second reason is, as Leonard says from the notes he gathered about the crime he's avenging, that the perpetrators had a car stashed with drugs outside.

From the assumption that Teddy knew Leonard before the main plot of the movie as a corrupt cop and a drug dealer, we can get many pieces that fit well in their place. Teddy would want to know what Leonard is doing because he's a witness who potentially would be able to testify that there was one other person during the breaking. When realizing he doesn't pose a danger to him, he may then realize he can use his need for revenge and also manipulate him. At first, he may have helped him kill the perpetrator of the crime Leonard is avenging. It could be, for example, a person who has irresponsibly lost drugs that he could profit from—the ones that police seized afterwards. We know that at one point Leonard thought he probably avenged the killing of his wife. Someone has made a picture of him smiling, where he is pointing to a place on his chest on the heart place where he would put another tattoo. This place would have a writing ""I've done it"". He imagined that in the scene at the end, with his narration in the background about need in believing in what he's doing in his search.

We knew that Teddy withheld the picture because he later slipped it to Leonard under the door. For example, he may have made Leonard forget he avenged his wife; it could have happened in a way similar to how Natalie deceived Leonard when she did. Teddy may have mocked Leonard while withholding the picture, for example, at gunpoint, and said things that he would make him kill another time. That could make Leonard create tattoo ""never answer the phone"" in the tattoo shop.

Jimmy Grantz may have known about the things Teddy is doing with Leonard, about killing and deceiving him; that's why he was so derisive to him at the beginning of their interaction, when he didn't know he would be his next target right before it. He called him ""memory men"" and asked if he's expecting any other Jimmies in the place they met. We also know Jimmy told Natalie about Leonard, his condition, and his check-in at a specific motel. 

After Leonard's correct kill, Teddy may have manipulated Leonard into killing Jimmy Grants, which Teddy could have profited from as well. He set up their meeting and convinced Leonard he's the real killer. After that, something for Leonard doesn't feel right; he gets suspicious, even paranoid, to the point that he even thinks that Jimmy's dead body mentioned Sammy Jenkins. Then Teddy comes in; he mostly lies to Leonard but also admits he made him kill someone Leonard didn't want to. Leonard gets angry at what he made him do and plans to make him his target by giving himself clues that he's the real killer of his wife. 

This theory wouldn't look like Leonard is that easily manipulated into killing and looking so delusional or psychotic, which I don't think would fit. I know he had brain damage with the condition, but there are countless examples in the movie when he shows how smart he was and that he had good intuition. At the same time, he was well motivated because the last thing he memorized gave him that strong drive to solve the crime. He also had extensive knowledge of the condition from the time he was an investigator. Also, it's noted that he was good at his job. He mentioned that in his work, he dealt a lot with cops, and they helped him with notes.

I also like the theory because there is a nice theme to it. Leonard got his justice, even though it wasn't perfect, and people related to his wife's death were punished, including people who manipulated him into doing something he didn't want to do because of it.

From what I researched, Nolan wasn't that clear in explaining what happened, but he pointed out that the audience tended to unfairly not believe Teddy. In my opinion, this description of Teddy may fit the theory, because even though Teddy was lying, even to a degree of contradicting himself in front of Leonard, it would appear he did reveal the truth, at least to some degree.

In the end, I want to exclude theories that I don't think have merit. I don't think Leonard made up Sammy. Also, I don't think he killed his wife himself with insulin. I know that in the end, there are quick flashes of image when Sammy turns into Leonard in the institution. There is also another scene where Leonard injects his wife with insulin and another where his wife is blinking through a transparent cloth. In my opinion, Sammy turning into Leonard was to show how similar Leonard feels to Sammy. On the other hand, the other flashes present confusion in Leonard's head at that time because of what Teddy was saying. I could speak more about why I don't think the other interpretations of those flashes, assuming Leonard makes up Sammy, don't fit that well. At the same time, as I mentioned, I think Leonard was indeed hallucinating Jimmy mentioning Sammy. At that time, I think Jimmy was already dead, and I think it was Leonard's subconscious intuition speaking, because something didn't feel right for him. The flash of injecting insulin and the hallucination fit with the confusion he felt in that situation that he was put in because of Teddy.

The other theory I'm suspicious of is that Leonard killed many other people than those two I describe and Teddy. I know Teddy is suggesting this, but he lied a lot at the same time to confuse Leonard. In my opinion, there wasn't that much time for Leonard to kill between the robbery and the events of the movie. The evidence I see seems to show that the time of the robbery wasn't that distant from the main plot of the movie. I could also talk more about it.

&#x200B;

I wanted to share this theory for a long time. I reminded myself of the movie recently in a brief way, but back in the day, I explored it in detail. It's just the theory, and I don't think there is definite proof for it, but I think it's a pretty good one.",movies

Maybe he wouldn’t be cast, which is fine, but I feel he should be in the running as one of the best (can’t be more than a handful) of actors who can pull off the dry, straight man character. 

Look at Hot Shots and Scary Movie 3. Regardless if you liked the movies themselves, there’s no denying his performances were rooted in what Nielsen essentially created. 

Nothing against Neeson, as I’m sure the movie will be fine. 

EDIT: I explicitly stated this has nothing to do with “why wasn’t he cast…”. My point of this post was to say that Sheen had proven his ability to be the straight guy in an absurd environment. ",movies

I couldn't help but feel the film wanted to push Popeye and even his partner in a bad light. Criticizing their constant arrests and assaults on low-level criminals who don't really deserve all the attention and harassment those two bring to them. I almost feel that this movie presents this method as asinine. It clearly shows that not even the justice system puts as much value or concern into any of these people based on how little time they spend in jail. Could be a criticism of the justice system but I saw it more as almost an advocacy or reason to decriminalize drugs and to find new methods to combat drug use and trafficking instead of constantly shaking down/throwing low-level dealers or users in jail. This idea is pretty progressive for the 70s. Just wanted to put that out there and see what others think. ,movies

So how would the SDS 101 take of John if they left the country?  John needs food, clothes, shelter………and they are wanted by all authorities.  What’s the plan?

2. In T2, how did the T1000 use the Time Machine?  It has no living tissue.  Even if it can mimic living tissue it’s not real and breaks the rule of the Time Machine of the first movie.

3. In the original terminator movie, what happened to the rest of the terminator?  I know it was crushed but seems like the there would be more left than just the hand and one chip.

4. How does the SDS101 heal its living tissue?  It doesn’t eat or drink anything to supply nutrients to rebuild the cells.  Also how does the skin and everything not all die off after a while?

Heavy spoilers ahead, all tagged out. If you have any intention of watching this film, I suggest you do it blind, and skip this post.

>!I recently finished Dream Scenario. I think it is a spectacular film,  but I don't fully understand the intention of including the in-dream advertisements. It's introduced very late into the film, there only being 15 minutes left when they show the Norio, a device that allows you to enter other people's dreams, and the creator of the Norio explains the intention of advertising.!<

>!I do understand how the Norio is necessary to wrap up Paul Matthews' arc. In the beginning of the film, he is upset that he does nothing in these people's dreams. While buildings collapse and alligators attack, he stands still, an observer in their subconscious minds. He is inconsequential. This mirrors Paul's real life. He is boring, uninteresting, and passive. He makes no great moves. When someone steals an idea of his (appropriately the idea relates to the behavior of a hive mind) he meets with them, and instead of threatening legal action, or going off on them for ripping off his work, he pleads with them, begging to be recognized in their research. For all intents and purposes, Paul is a pathetic person, and in the communal subconscious of the world, people's dreams reflect that.!<

>!At the end of the film, Paul takes action against people. He is upset that he is being villainized for the subconscious fantasies of other people, and he becomes more proactive to fight for his personal rights. Paul gets his hands on a Norio, and enters into the dream of his wife, where he helps her escape a wall of fire, trapping her against a pillar. When Paul is actually physically capable of controlling himself in the dreams, he is active and helpful, which is more reflective of who Paul wants to be.!<

>!All of this is well and good, but the inclusion of the advertisements doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't service Paul's arc, nor does it contribute to the commentary on cancel culture. It does introduce the Norio to the audience, but is communicated more as a tool for advertisers, and it didn't even occur to me until Paul got his hands on one that anyone could just buy one, so in my opinion I don't think the scene does a good job of that. There is another minor scene shortly after this where two individuals try to advertise things to Paul in his dreams, but this doesn't really seem to service the plot in any way either.!<

I assume I am just misunderstanding the intention of these scenes, or am maybe just ignorant to another message that was included in this film. What do you guys think? Is it possible these scenes are remnants of a prior script, one that comments on the effect of subconscious advertising? ",movies

But it's still the same core group of actors doing impossible stunts while talking about family.

The initial Rambo film explores the impact of PTSD and veteran treatment, while the sequels become intense celebrations of warfare.

I'd argue that Friday the 13th changed the most. The second film changed who the killer was. The third film changed how he looked, introducing the hockey mask. The sixth film introduce supernatural elements. The tenth film changed the genre to science fiction, sending Jason into space.

I was immediately fascinated with the concept when I first saw the trailer. No dialogue, actors covered in costumes and makeup, and apparent comedic undertones. Seemed to be up my alley.

I was really hoping going in that it didn't end up being a pretentious art film, and it certainly was not. There were comedic moments, but it was never the focus of the movie.

As a whole, it has such an amazing heart. You really begin to feel and identify with the characters immediately (or at least I did). This makes the sad moments hit harder, and the touching moments that much more impactful.

With a runtime of 89 minutes, it also doesn't outstay its welcome.

I can see how this would be a love it or hate movie with no real middle ground. I however loved it. There is no spoken dialogue (just grunts and howls), yet I was never once confused by what was going on, or the purpose of any of the scenes. The actors here did a tremendous job. Adding all of that with a perfectly fitting soundtrack, and the gorgeous backdrop of the north California mountains, I believe this should be destined to be a beloved cult classic.

This time, he hurls his first attacker to the ground and stomps on his neck, moving to the next opponent before his first victim's head stops limply wobbling. And then you consider the historical context and appreciate how cathartic it is for a Chinese man to be beating up WW2 Japanese.

But it is the WORST example of ""lets attack him one at time"" I have seen in a movie. They try to keep the camera tightly focused on Donnie Yen but you can still see fighters in the background doing nothing but flailing their arms, swaying side to side, and watching him beat the everliving crap out of one person.

Also it's 10 fighters against him and three ""squads"" are named to fight Donnie so they don't have equal numbers per squad which bothers me more than it should.

What other movie scenes that should be deeply striking but fail due to movie rules or poor decisions?",movies

szvd9,1c9vbdc,1713740160.0,What is the best movie they still haven't made according to you?,"As I'm sure many of you are just as crazy about film as I am....What movie do you have in your head often as a movie you'd love to see but they still haven't made to this day? This can include casting choices and whatever else you'd like to explain but as a minimum for an answer lets agree on describing the plot and why you'd love to see it. Sequels, prequels, original ideas..let's hear it!

My idea:

I'd love to see a movie about a possessed man or woman and have it be from his/her perspective. Show this person working, behaving in a negative fashion, crossing ethic lines and have the possession come into focus late into the movie (hearing voices, seeing imagery) and have the audience slowly come to the conclusion of possession. Maybe even make it a bit ambiguous in the end if it actually was that or just a psychological problem and give just enough examples to explain both sides of the argument. Forgo all the exorcism antics and vomit tropes of the genre and make it into a psychological thriller and have the director never pick a side. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and in the lead I'd cast Jodie Comer who is very good linguistically and have that play into the part of possession. (Have her speak many languages in the film only to later find out nobody knew she'd speak anything else but English for example) and as a supporting cast I'd use unknowns.",movies
263x2icg,1c9v7zf,1713739900.0,I'm Not There (2007) Appreciation ,"A new Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown written and directed by James Mangold, is around the corner. I'd like to say how much I appreciate I'm Not There as an unconventional biopic that fit so well with the ever changing persona of Dylan. I really appreciate how the movie explores how different people can be at different stages of their lives, and doesn't shoehorn Dylan into a single persona like so many othe biopics do with their subjects. It also seems like it anticipated the satire of Walk Hard (also 2007), and reinvented what a dramatic music biopic could look like. Walk Hard questioned why we made biopics like this and I'm Not There preemptively answered that we don't have to.

The reason being, it is such an amalgamation of some really good things and some comically shitty things (the piano sounds like it's out of tune?!?!). This is my tin foil hat theory based on no experience ""in the industry.""

Did they spend too much initially and then run out of money?

Jake G and the muscles$$$; that entire boat/bomb/ water battle$$$, maybe Connor Mc Gregor (either really expensive or he did it for free; it should be near free because the only acting was him going by the name Knox and even then they wrote Knox three times on his stomach so he would remember it)$$

Good things; Jake G, obviously. I almost always enjoy his movies. I thought the first 15 minutes or so was done well. For me, the movie started coming off the rails immediately before the train crash (you're welcome ;) The boat/bomb scene was fun. The fight sequence at the end has some cool 1st person camera effects at times.

Bad things; I don't need to spend much more on bad things other than; I can't remember a movie that I have seen recently that not only struggled to find an identity, but didn't even care to try. The scene with the broken arm guy who was only there to “ride motorcycles with other people” seemed out of place with the type of humor.

,1c9r348,1713729509.0,Clooney and Julia Roberts's relationship in Oceans 11 is creepy and manipulative. ,"So I watched this movie recently for the first time since I was a kid. I remember the relationship between Danny (Clooney) and Tess (Roberts) as romantic and charming, but after watching it again, It's incredibly weird and gross.

Danny (her ex husband) shows up uninvited to a dinner between her and her new boyfriend and obviously tries to make both of them uncomfortable by doing so. He then proceeds to basically stalk her for the rest of the film. Utimately, he sets her boy friend up to admit on camera that he would rather get his $100m back (that Danny stole) and give her up in exchange, making sure she was watching it live as it was happening. This upsets her enough that she decides to leave her boyfriend and go back to Danny?!? Their relationship is so manipulative and abusive I couldn't really think of much else after turning the film off.

7xfjh,1c9odj2,1713722766.0,Modern (action) movies where the characters are NOT invincible,"I just saw Bullet Train (2022) and found it was an absolute blast.

What I enjoyed most was that the characters were all highly competent fighters and yet they suffered or even lost their fights quite a lot.

This reminded me a lot of old action movies, particularly Jackie Chan films or early Die Hard where the protagonist was not some invincible monster. There were real stakes. The characters got hurt.

I don’t want to dump on any specific films or franchises but many modern films have completely missed this for me. Fights are boring because nobody ever looks like they are in danger or gets hurt.

A lot of what works in Bullet Train comes from the choreography which was very creative, dynamic and actually used the gimmick of the train rather than it feeling like generic choreo that would work in any location. The location of the train comes in to play at every moment. It was a breath of fresh air.

So I ask: What other recent movies - specifically action movies I guess (though this isn’t unique to action films) - did fight scenes have such good tension and stakes where lead characters actually suffer, are on the back foot, get hurt, or even die?

8q93v6f8,1c9lif1,1713715454.0,Roles Cate Blanchett turned down,"The Queen of Acting and supercoolness has had and still has an extraordinary career in both film, television and on stage. Here is a small list of roles she declined for different reasons 

01) Portia 
Blanchett was the original choice to play Portia in this Michael Redford adaption of The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare. Blanchett had to drop out in the last minute due to pregnancy. We were robbed of Blanchett and Pacino acting together. The interesting thing is that Ian McKellen was also cast in the movie and dropped out in the last minute due to scheduling conflicts. So we were also robbed by Ian and Cate acting once again in the same movie. 
The cast is: Al Pacino, Lynn Collins, Jeremy Irons, Charlie Cox, Joseph Fiennes etc 

02) Anna 
Cate Blanchett had to drop out right before filming started due to pregnancy. Director Mike Nichols had to recast the role of Anna. The candidate were Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts. He went with Roberts. This role became like a renessaince for Julia Roberts in getting better and more dramatic work in the future to come. We were robbed of Blanchett acting with Law, Owen and Portman. I believe the decision to drop out of this really hurt Blanchett. The script is adapted by Patrick Marber. Marber later wrote a role for Blanchett in Notes on a Scandal. I believe Closer would have been a way better movie with Blanchett. Her delivery of Anna’s line would have been so fire! And hopefully, in fantasy land, netted her a second best actress nomination and a possible double nomination since this is the same year as The Aviator. 
The cast: Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. 

03) Marianne Lane 
Cate Blanchett was the original choice to play Marianne Lane in A Bigger Splash, directed by Luca Guadagnino. Tilda Swinton replaced her and the rest is history. Since the replacement is as strong as Blanchett itself, I have no complaints. But we were robbed of a reunion between Blanchett and Fiennes since their Oscar and Lucinda days. Blanchett declined due to her on stage performance in The Maids with Isabelle Huppert and Elizabeth Debicki in New York. Margot Robbie was also originally cast but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. We were robbed of a possible Aussie duo Cate-Margot fire on screen together. 
The cast: Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Dakota Johnson and Matthias Schoenarts 

04) Agatha 
Blanchett was committed to play Agatha in Minority Report by Steven Spielberg. But because Spielberg wanted to do A.I first, the filming was postponed from late 1999 to April 2001. Blanchett dropped out due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by Samantha Morton. Morton was fantastic as Agatha so no complaints here. Both Ian McKellen and Meryl Streep were also attached to the movie, but that did not happen. We were robbed once again with a possible Cate-Ian duo on screen and Blanchett with Tom Cruise as well. 
The cast: Samantha Morton, Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, Jessica Capshaw and more. 

05) Isabel / Izzi Creo 
In early 2002, Blanchett and Brad Pitt was about to start shooting The Fountain by Darren Aronofsky. But because Pitt and Aronofsky had major creative differences, the project was shut down. The roles were recast in 2004 with Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Though Weisz is a good actress, I am still curious about what Blanchett could do in an Aronofsky movie.
 The cast: Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, Ellen Burstyn etc 

06) Francis Ford Coppola 
Cate Blanchett mention she had been contacted by Francis Ford Coppola for a role “When Francis calls, just have to say yes. Because you’re on the epic life-changing adventure ride. You’re on that roller coaster. I’m ready for that” 

Well she dropped out of Megapolis so what ever happen that, I dunno

07) Lucille Ball 
For many, many years, Cate Blanchett has talked about Lucille Ball and potentially playing her. She was cast with Aron Sorkin both directing and writing. Blanchett dropped because the movie went in a direction she was not ready for. Kidman was replaced and the result was not very good at all. Oscar Isaac was in talks as well

08) Pay gap difference in spring 2018
She was offered a lead role and getting lesser paid than her male co-lead. Cate tried to negotiate with the studio but they said no. And so did she. The greatest actress in the world with two Oscars and highly acclaimed movies, could not get equal pay in 2018. That is so gross 

09) Considered for 
Clarice Starling in Hannibal / Ada in Cold Mountain/  Roxy Heart in Chicago / Evelyn Johnson in Pearl Harbor / Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable / Jane Smith in Mr & Mrs Smith/ Hippolyta in Wonder Woman

10) Illeana 
Cate was offered the role of Illeana in Taking Lives by D.J. Caruso. Angelina Jolie got the part. The cast: Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Gena Rowlands, Kiefer Sutherland, Olivier Martinez etc 

11) Mrs Fox
 Blanchett was set to voice Mrs Fox in the Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr Fox, but was replaced by Meryl Streep for undisclosed reasons

12) Melissa Lewis 
Blanchett was committed to play Melissa Lewis in The Martian, but had to drop out due to her on stage schedule with The Maids in New York. Jessica Chastain replaced her. I’m glad she dropped out because the role itself is not that much. Chastain is a good replacement and doing her best

3wtw9ezy,1c9hxj3,1713706190.0,My thoughts on The Virgin Suicides (1999) - an essay ,"TL;DR - this movie is a story of what happens when one is dehumanised, turned into someone's fantasy, an object of desires and therefore deprived of meaningful connections. That is the answer to the question of ""Why they did it?"" in my opinion.


I just saw the movie, and wanted to share my perception of it. I've seen a lot of comments about how the movie didn't explain things properly and it's unclear why the girls did what they did.

But, I think the main message it's pretty clear.

First of all, right from the beginning, it's important to keep in my that the story is told from the boys™ perspective. It's how they remember the story.

But, as a viewer, you must catch things that are reality to better understand the girls.

Now, one thing I noticed - its often repeated how the parents' attitude and strictness were main reason for girls ending their lives, but I actually disagree. They were strict, for sure, but look at the girls lifestyles and clothing? They all wear ""modern"" outfits, they can tan and hang out outside in clothes more revealing than what puritans would allow. They have rock records, makeup, books, they are interested in science. They read magazines and journal and *own* a lot.

Sure, they are not allowed to hang out with boys, but boys are allowed for dinner, even the party at the beginning - surely, it was heavily supervised, but you can see the parents made an *attempt*. They were strict, but Lux still managed to smoke and flirt with boys secretly, hence they were not *that* controlling.

They did allow the girls to go prom at the end of the day. The father was a teacher and took great interest in physics. He was just delighted when Lux won the prom queen.

The parents were strict Christians, but they were not crazy, they were not cult-level puritans like the mother in Carrie lets say. 

What is important though, is that their strictness really fed into the boys™ idea of the girls. They saw them as this unattainable objects of desire, kept in cage, mysterious, innocent. *They never saw them as real human beings*.

Now, Cecilia's suicide. I delved a bit into how the book described Cecilia, and it seems like her push for suicide was that she felt like she didn't belong. She was into nature: talking to her mom about frogs, writing about trees in her journal (which boys™ just skipped cause *boring*). She didn't feel in place at the party, she saw how they treated the kid with Down syndrome. Her tree was set up to get cut, I think she couldn't really connect with her parents either. Her room was full of drawings and models and trinkets. She wears the same white dress she wore for suicide. Her thoughts and trouble were deep, and arguably, the therapist's advice to simply introduce her to more boys was not helpful at all. Like everyone, he attributed her issues solely to the parents' strict parenting style. Society (doctors, therapist) failed to actually see and treat her mental heath issues simply because (just like the boys™) they couldn't see her as her own person.

In the movie, Cecilia was first to go. The boys™ describe how the town reacted to the death, what they said on the news, but never how the sisters reacted to it and how it impacted them. We only see a glimpse of mouring in the movie. And then, they're back to school. ""Like nothing happened"".

One haunting scene is of Bonnie in Cecilia's room when her father sees her. She says ""they took out the fence"". It's clear she was in pain, but it's never delved into.

What's interesting, we don't really see the sisters interacting with other girls in school. We only see a glimpse of Bonnie working on a project with her classmates, and when death is mentioned they turn to her to apologise for bringing it up. It's shallow, it's clear they see them in a similar way to the boys, as something distant. The sisters keep to themselves, the boys lust over them, the school king Trip is into Lux. We can only guess why they couldn't build any meaningful connections with the other girls, or if the boys simply don't notice them. My personal take would be that other girls were jealous, the looks sisters caught at prom were not warm at all.
It would explain further how the sisters ended up in a bubble, all in the same position which made the suicide *pact* a possibility. 

Lux was the most fleshed out character. She was the most desirable, and attainable, for the boys™. She's the biggest ""rebel"", she smokes, listens to rock, flirts. She's a very typical teenage girl but is not seen as such due to her family. She's a ""Lisbon girl"".

With Trip - she genuinely liked him. And honestly it felt like he liked her too at first... However, it becomes clear that he indeed only saw her as a prize and achievement. The reason he left her in the field is because he made it, he took her virginity and it hit him that she is real, that she could do something so ""dirty"" - there was no mystery, she was a teenage girl yearning for love and validation and physical closeness. Trip broke her entirely. She made out with guys on the roof, asking them if they liked her and they didn't even reply. Out of all the sisters, she was the most lusted over by far. She was deeply hurting.

I think the entire prom sequence is crucial. It showcases the *real* Lisbon sisters the most. The way they say ""they're gonna ruffle us out"" when football boys come to pick them up? They feel how guys perceive them and it hurts them. In a car, the 3 older sisters gossip about neighbours, making mean comments, a very shallow conversation which clearly did not fit into the guys vision of them, of pure yet sensual and sophisticated maidens. 

During prom the sisters are awkward, the dances are awkward, that entire interaction with Bonnie and the guy she kissed but didn't like it? *Awkward.* *Normal.*

The guys Trip brought most likely expected them to either be teasing and confident and provocative like Lux (who genuinely felt something for Trip) or graceful angels they made up in their mind. Instead, they were hit with reality. Mary showing how she didn't like the guy she was with, asking not to walk her to the door, Therese (dare I say desperately) asking a guy if he's gonna call her. And he never did.

What Trip did was horrible. As a consequence, it triggered the mother completely. The parents were more or less bearable until their biggest fear became true - their 14? 15? year daughter slept with a guy in middle of the football field, got ditched by him, and had to go back home at dawn in a taxi. It's a traumatic experience for literally anyone.

The mother spiraled, on top of Lux's heartbreak her records got destroyed. The sister were locked inside. There they are - locked in, unable to build any meaningful relationships outside of their own group. The guys don't like the real them. They lost their youngest sister, and it was treated as a show; a tree - their fond memory of her, was going to get cut down. And their protest was about to get treated as a show (the news).

The sisters were suffering, and through all that you have the boys™ watching their every move. Obsessing with them, having their things, but never bothering to actually build any contact with them. Even when the boys™ called, they melancholically played music and never actually talked. It was the sisters who were reaching out.

Remember a scene in school when one of the boys™ tries to talk to Mary and introduces himself? She says ""I know who you are, I've been going to this school my whole life; you don't have to bother to talk to me"".

What drove the sisters to suicide was *dehumanisation* of theirselves.

With parents as theirs, it's hard to connect to them. Usually teens would seek those connection outside, in friends and lovers, but no one would actually give it to the Lisbon sisters. They were different, but at end of the day they shared the same depression.

What if any of those boys took genuine interest and went to dinners with Lisbons and actually tried and held conversations with the family and talked with girls over the phone for example; or wrote letters - anything? What if Trip was respectful and brought Lux home at time? Perhaps the parents would've actually let go even more? What if the sisters had female friends? What if people let them mourn in peace?

They invited the boys to their suicide as a ""fuck you"". And yet the boys™, now men™ still obsess over them the same way.

The line the boys™ say: ""*They never heard us call them from our rooms*"" is infuriating - it was the other way around! It's heartbreaking, and it's truly nails the message of this film.

Lux wasn't even a technically a virgin. But, who cares, right? The title itself communicates the message.",movies

This film got so much praise and is considered a cult classic. It holds an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, 5 Star on Amazon Prime, 7.5 IMDb, etc.. I heard about it as a kid so much because of the game so i decided to finally watch it..  but I don’t get it? I’m a native New Yorker and I’m from the Bronx my whole life. I don’t quite get the hype of all this. Yeah it’s cool to see NY in the 70’s but I could just go to the transit museum and see the same stuff in person. The whole “this really did happen” thing doesn’t change anything for me. It’s just a bad movie lol.

The acting is awkward, really slow, hardly any excitement, everything felt flat, the outfits are cheesy, The fighting scenes look terribly fake and severley exaggerated. I mean these kids beat up groups of people with knives, 2x4’s, guns, and bats  with their bars hands while weighing a whopping 120lbs each.

Cleon dissapears after the whole mix up and no one ever finds him again nor do they care to after the first scene (so much for being a beloved leader), Fox gets tossed into the train tracks and nobody notices or misses him (yes ik he was fired and killed off), apparently neither do the police care because by the time Swan went back to “find the rest” there’s no ambulance outside, EMT’s, or police investigation going on. Guess the cop that tossed him just got up and walked away after committing involuntary manslaughter? Y’know there’s just a dead body split in half on the tracks chilling, that’s regular! 

I mean I know its the 70’s but for crying out loud.

Btw, 60% of the movie is also just them running. Which they do very well, so much so that they can outrun a bus somehow.

Then the final scene at the Beach is this huge BS knife toss to disarm the antagonist who was a nobody with a revolver in the first place. The gun fires before getting dropped but somehow hits nobody within 2 feet of it. Then they turn and are surprised (because their peripheral vision seemed to not exist) to see an army of 100 black guys spectating them as if they couldn’t see them at 5AM in Coney Island.

fcx0l5gc,1c9av8y,1713679791.0,Guy Ritchie's Style,"I'm watching The Gentlemen, the Netflix show produced in 2024 by Guy Ritchie (who shared director responsibilities with 3 other directors). I think the length of the show has allowed him to go into far more detail than before, and it really emphasizes what his shows are about. 

I think the secret is that his shows are comedies. The actual story he's telling is gritty and raw, often some sort of realistic crime, but all of the characters are acting comically, as if to make fun of the entire concept. In other words, you might say he writes action satire.

It's a clever exaggeration, as if to swaggerize whatever it is the characters are doing. If you take it literally, the characters are dumber and it's shallow. If you understand that the characters are not what they appear (they are actually smarter), then you realize it's not a literal show. That's why it's satire. I guess I'm just not too familiar with the fact that hero movies are often satire.

Ok, so I think there's a relationship between swagger and satire. In a satire, you act cool but are dumb, and in a swagger portrayal, you act dumb but are cool. Comedies can do either, or neither as there are many comedy forms. So, I think the Guy Ritchie style is not satire, but swagger.

rnjelwpv,1c98a28,1713670304.0,The Tragedy of Coriolanus Snow (Movie Ver.)," It took me a while to watch the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes after reading the book but I can say I was thoroughly surprised at how good the movie was. It is lacking compared to the book but when looking only at the film I'd give it a solid 8/10.

Now I've seen a lot of people saying how Snow is irredeemable and a villain throughout the entire movie. While this may be true in the books I don't think it is in the film. I know we can't see his thoughts like in the novel so it's hard to see his deeper motivations but the Snow we do see is most definitely not entirely evil. I believe there were 3 main influences for snows eventual descent into ""evil"". While there are 2 main influences which serve as incentives for snow to remain more neutral maybe even ""good"".

The first person that would serve to corrupt Coryo is his grandmother. She was a Classist and believed wholeheartedly that the districts were beneath them. She constantly fueled the power-hungry and conniving side of Snow, telling him if he doesn't use Lucy Gray he'll end up **""dead in the trees, like your father**"". The second and largest influence was without a doubt, Volumnia Gaul. As Head Game maker, she had enviable political power and was essentially the face of Capitol Cruelty. Her methods were violent and inhumane all of which she likely passed on to her star pupil Coriolanus Snow. However, what we see Gaul do in the actual movie is a tad more subtle. As Snow displayed empathy towards Lucy Gray Baird throughout but specifically at the end of the games. Dr. Gaul sees that Snow is falling towards the side of ethics and righteous morality. This angers Gaul as she can see his potential so she has Highbottom expel him from the academy knowing he'll most likely find his was to District 12. After he makes his decision to leave 12, Gaul sees that he has left Lucy Gray behind along with his morality fulfilling her plan all along. She then leaves us with that chilling smile. ""**Welcome home, Snow**"". the Final and most controversial bad influence is none other than Dean Casca Highbottom. The reason I say controversial is because he had the most potential to be a positive role model for Coryo but ends up driving him to become a vicious snake. His hatred towards Coryo stems from how Snows father wronged him back in the day. Now this makes Dean Highbottom cold and cruel to Snow even though he does not deserve this. Potentially giving him the weakest looking tribute or sending him away to District 8 to be ""**an anonymous peacekeeping grunt**"". If Highbottom had simply put aside his feelings towards Crassus he might have seen a brilliant young man who could've helped him stop the games.

Enough about the bad. I mentioned that Snow had 2 positive influences along with his negative ones. The first and closest to him was his cousin Tigris. Tigris during the film attempted to contrast all the negative authorities who corrupted her Coryo. She repeatedly tries to instill in him the fact that people from the districts were people too and seems to directly oppose violence and revenge. When Snow found out about the mentor system Tigris told him to put himself in her shoes and always consoled him when something went wrong. This was in direct opposition to their grandmother and Dr. Gaul. Tigris and Snows relationships serves as symbolism for familial and unconditional love. However this becomes more and more one-sided as their relationship begins to strain towards the end of the movie. we see Tigris go from affectionately calling Snow ""Coryo"" in the beginning to middle sections to her coyly calling him ""Coriolanus"" at the end of the film. Now last but not least lets talk about Snows antithesis and love interest, Lucy Gray Baird. Her and Snow are complete opposites in class status, districts where they live and education and physical abilities. Now, Despite all of this, these two are able to find some common ground. they both care deeply for their families, they've both dealt with adversity and evil and they both end up caring for each other. Lucy Gray is probably the biggest positive influence in Snows life. She shows him what its like to not be a Capitol elite and cares deeply for him even though they just met. While Snow is a little more possessive and obsessive over Lucy Gray in the books I would ***maybe*** call it love in the Movie. Snow is taught compassion by Lucy Gray and he ends up deeply infatuated with her. The reasons I think Snow actually may have loved Lucy Gray include the fact that after Dean Highbottom tells Snow He'll never win the Plinth Prize, he still tries his hardest to help Lucy Gray survive. Along with Lucy Gray being the only one who was able to almost convince Snow to give up his life-long ambition for power. Regardless of all this Lucy Gray was the one who deeply haunted Snow and influenced him the most with him going so far as to marry a woman he hated so he would never be weakened by love like with Lucy Gray Baird. The Lucy and Coryo ending scene was incredibly heartbreaking but well written and meant to be. I personally think Lucy Gray was watching him and when he came out with the gun that was the final straw, the trust they had was gone and smoking, set ablaze by Snows earlier lie about killing his old self. Earlier we got to see that trust is everything to her. ""**Without trust, you might as well be dead to me**"". Paranoia got to the both of them. Although, with Lucy you could say she loved him enough to let him go and become the man *he thinks* he was meant to be.

I don' t see how people can hate Snow throughout the whole movie. Hes been through hell and I can only imagine what that does to you. He is driven to be what he becomes by everyone in his life positive and negative. At the end of the day Snow played a background character to his own descent. Conflicting influences good and evil ripped at him until one side emerged victorious. as Lucy Gray Baird said. ""**People aren**'**t so bad, not really, Its what the world does to them. Like all of us in the arena. I think there's a natural goodness born into us all. You can either cross that line into evil, or not.**""",movies

wdxun,1c976rh,1713666564.0,The best action heroes are the ones that are in over their heads,"I’ve noticed that my favorite actions heroes are ones that really have no idea what they’re doing but improvise and make their way through. Examples that come to mind are Harrison Ford as either Indy or Han, Tom Cruise in MI, and John McLean in the first Die Hard. These characters are often not cool, calm, and collected when people start shooting at them or when they have to jump out of planes. They’re surprised at the situations they find themselves in and apprehensive about what to do, but they do it.  They’re vulnerable but their ability to think and act on the fly is what gets them through. They’re stressed which makes them human, but witty which makes them like-able. Too many action movies think that we want a hero is always knows what do and is never flustered because that’s “cooler”. I find that thinking usually makes the character altogether more forgettable. There are of course exceptions to the always calm hero (Bourne movies), but overall I love it when the film’s action hero is at the end of their rope and kind of freaking out, but still finds a way through that the audience can relate to and appreciate.",movies

56u37dg2,1c96ryj,1713665193.0,Best actor in a role that through no fault of their own was never given a fair chance?,"Recently I watched the Doctor Who TV Movie, and whilst very of its time one thing that absolutely stands out is the great Paul McGann as the eighth Doctor. What’s somewhat shocking to me considering how great McGann is in the role (and he really is fantastic) is that he was never given much of a chance to really play The Doctor for any significant amount of time beyond this movie and a short special a few years ago. The thing though is McGann was the absolute right choice at the wrong possible time. Coming immediately after Sylvester McCoy (by which point the series’ popularity was somewhat diminished) and right before the hiatus that eventually brought us Christopher Eccleston (who I personally think was the best to take on the role), McGann in the TV movie never really had much of a chance. Couple that with how American that TV movie feels (im aware it was made to appeal to the American audience rather than the British) he unfortunately wasn’t going to have much of a chance for long term continuity. This however doesn’t diminish his performance, since he brings all the energy, personality and tragedy to The Doctor that’s required. 

So I’m wondering, who are some other actors who, through absolutely no fault of their own and even give a great performance on screen, were never given a fair chance at the role? 

Edit: I do find it also quite funny that technically McGanns Withnail & I costar Richard E Grant technically did play The Doctor as well during a Red Nose Day comedy special",movies

Some actors get hyped by Hollywood, put into lots of big projects, and then the audience says, ""Nah.""

Some get a big film and it seems like they'll be the future, but then their star flickers and fades away.



Let's name a few - not to poke fun, just to remember, and maybe check them out again.



I'd pick **Felicity Jones** - She had high profile hits with very different movies, from biopics *The Invisible Wom*an and *The Theory of Everything* to blockbuster action adventure like *Inferno* and *Rogue One*, and was also going to top-line a Spider-Man spin-off until it was cancelled. Since then, by choice or not, she's had quiet dramas *On the Basis of Sex* and *The Last Letter from Your Lover* - but nothing as high-profile as what came before.

And **Kit Harrington**. *Game of Thrones* was obviously huge, and he had leads in historical disaster film *Pompeii* and spy thriller *Spooks: The Greater Good*. But then experimental drama *The Death & Life of John F. Donovan* and Marvel's under-performing *Eternals* put a question mark on things, and he's been buried in an ensemble in HBO/BBC's financial drama *Industry*.



Hopefully, these two, and others like them, can build back their career momentum.

She started out in Theater in London and was directed by Tony Richardson in her early career. She was excellent in ""The Collector"", playing a captive of a looney Terence Stamp, and equally impressive in ""The Brood,"",playing the worst mom in Film before Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest"", which I found to be  David Cronenberg's best film (sorry, ""Videodrome"" lovers). She played an actress in the low-budget '80s slasher ""Curtains"", which is an absolute favorite of mine and deserves to be seen by every aficionado of the genre, giallo in Canada. 

If I recall correctly, my impression was she got caught up in the Canadian film industry in the '70s and '80s, as she was a British export, and Canada was employing a lot of those in their films. The problem, however, was many of those films were tax shelter flicks or low budget, so many weren't great and didn't exactly bring much exposure to talent.

As a result, Samantha Eggar was left in career limbo since many of the Canadian films she did in the 1970s weren't seen by the public at large.

My favorite parts of all of the Ocean’s movies are the scenes of them just talking back and forth between their personal lives and “work”. It all just works so well.

ehu3osv1,1c8v1ua,1713633095.0,The Exorcist: Believer ,"I finally got around to watching The Exorcist: Believer yesterday, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, more so than the original, in fact.

Don't get me wrong, the original is definitely the better movie, but I didn't care for any of the characters. Conversely, in Believer, having a daughter of my own caused me to connect with the primary father of the film, and I felt significantly more emotion throughout its run time, which helped me appreciate it for more than just the horror elements.

I understand it's meant to be a legacy sequel, but I found more enjoyment in the movie when I looked at it as a standalone with minor element's from the original.",movies
npzc6so4,1c8uz68,1713632902.0,Jackie Chan's First Strike is great,"I've always loved the original Police Story. The balance between big stunts and martial arts and humour is just great. But the sequels just didn't make an impression. Police Story 3 especially just completely dropped the ball. Like even with the inclusion of Michelle Yeoh, the stop and go plot didn't help its chances. That 20 minute bonkers climax with the helicopter and train wasn't enough to save the film imo.

So yeah, I had low expectations from the beginning. First Strike, on the other hand was just great. The espionage plot kept me just hooked enough to enjoy the action. The number and scale of action sequences is huge.

The first sequence in the ski resort is better than all of the the previous setpieces except maybe the climax of 3. It just gets better from there. Soon Jackie is jumping from window to window of a skyscraper, and by the climax he is fighting bad guys underwater while avoiding sharks. It's just awesome all around.

The comedy has been toned down though, along with the aspects of his personal life. There aren't any dedicated slapstick sections like the telephone sequence in the first one. The humour now is mostly around the fish out of the water situation that Jackie is in when he's being used as a pawn in the illegal nuclear arms dealings.

The film currently holds a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Not that it really matters but a lot of people still look up these aggregate scores when deciding to watch a movie and such a rating can be off-putting. I agree that it's not Police Story anymore because of the espionage storyline but this is one of Jackie Chan's best efforts and as someone who loves his stunt work, this was a blast to watch. One of the best action films of the 90s

5pk9l8q9,1c8u9ln,1713631033.0,Questions about ‘No Country For Old Men’,"I know this movie has been discussed to hell and back but I just recently got into watching movies and I have a few questions I’d like some perspective on.

1 - why does Anton not kill the motel woman? I’ve seen the theory that he knows he isn’t alone due to the toilet flush, but why not just kill the other person too, seems simple enough. Was it her defiance that spared her? 

2 - Was the officers (his name escapes me) approaching the motel crime scene a symbol of testing fate? Anton is seen in the shadows, but the cop, to my recollection, leaves, which most likely spared his life.  Is everything the officer has done up to that point simply a reminder of how basically “men make plans and God laughs”, in the sense that he will never be able to get ahead of death. 


3 - Does Anton have a principled issue with killing children or does he just not kill those boys because he’s in no shape to do so? 

4 - this is an age old one that’s been debated - was that accountant killed? He asks “do you see me?” And I understand that basically no one sees Anton and lives, I just wonder if he meant it as “you never saw me” (similar to his comment to the two boys) or “is the sky blue?” And the accountant is then killed, and 

5 - what is the - or is there any -  meaning of the two scenes that were paralleled where Llewelyn (?) sees the three boys and gets a jacket, and the later scene with Anton and the car crash? Is this just a symbol of the foolish corruption money causes (the boy wants money for the beer and the other boy scolds him; the two boys begin to bicker over money the boy initially refused to take)?

e7opwsq9,1c8ttwl,1713629891.0,Fantastic Beasts & What went wrong,"As the title hints, in this post I'll post my recap of the film series and why it didn't work and got cancelled.

After the massive, multi billion dollar success of Harry Potter, everyone, literally everyone (fans, Warner Bross, Rowling, etc..), wanted more. More wizards, more of Harry's world, more magic, more everything... and Rowling delivered, or at least tried to.

And indeed after the first Fantastic Beasts movie (Fantastic Beasts & Where to find them), it seemed like another success of the Wizarding World was on the way. The movie was a hit, Harry Potter fans were back at theaters, Harry Potter (and Fantastic Beasts) merchandise exploded again, etc... Rowling planned 4 additional movies, fans were thrilled worldwide... nobody could suspect how quickly it would be forgotten and fall down, and franchise getting cancelled.

But, that's where the first problem (that nobody noticed) appeared. Billions of fans of Harry Potter worldwide are fans of Harry Potter, not fans of the world of Harry Potter... and Fantastic Beasts weren't Harry Potter. They were never going to be. In many ways, they're a different film genre.. with Harry Potter film series being movies about a wizard kid growing up, discovering who he is, and what he's supposed to do. Harry Potter was targeted to kids, and kids alone. 

With FB, Rowling's idea was obviously to tell a story about the big Dumbledore vs Grindelwald war (something billions of fans have been asking for ever since the final book was released), through the eyes and adventures of Newt and Tina. Fantastic Beasts were meant to be more of a romantic comedy, following the story of romantically involved main leads, who deal with the problems they cause, while the big Dumbledore vs Grindelwald conflict loomed in the back. And as such, FB wasn't primarily targeted to kids, it was targeted to young adults most of all. At first it does seem understandable, given the fact that most kids who were growing up obsessed with Harry Potter were young adults now, but the thing is, magic and wands do not really work with young adults as they do with kids... sure, they're all going to go and see the movie, thrilled for more Harry Potter, but they'll need more than that to get hooked to it, and here's where Fantastic Beasts & Where to find them failed imo. Sure it was a nice spin off to Harry Potter, but it failed at getting people hooked up and building it's own franchise.

Another mistake was that the movie was targeted at old Harry Potter fans, not at making new fans. Sure, at first you think how can anything go bigger than Harry Potter, are there really any more fans to be made? And the answer is yes, new generations of kids, that were kids at the time when FB were being released, that weren't born yet at Harry Potter's times... not young adults that already grew up with Harry Potter.

Does this mean that the film series was doomed to failure from the start and there was never any hope? Absolutely not, the movie was a huge success, it just needed to ""work harder"" to build up the franchise, a strong second movie would do that... but that's where things started to go downhill very fast.

Fantastic Beasts, the Crimes of Grindelwald wasn't that good of a movie. The problem was that Rowling took on the writing all by herself, and though she's a brilliant story writer she lacked experience in writing film scripts... and that's what Crimes of Grindelwald ended up being, a good story (in idea) that wasn't executed that well. Rowling tried to tell two stories and practically squeeze in two movies into one. The result was the worst of both worlds. The movie tried to be both Fantastic Beasts 2, centering on Newt and Tina/Jacob and Queeny with their magical beasts, and Crimes of Grindelwald, with Grindelwald's plans, Lestrange family drama, with Leta Lestrange as the main central character. In the end both plots got cut short, we got an undeveloped central character (Leta Lestrange), Newt and Tina's story cut short, all major plots cut short and going nowhere... the movie wasn't well received at all.

Another huge problem for the already damaged franchised was covid. Warner Bros wasn't sure what to do with it even, before, but said, heck let's try to save it with a third film, but covid got in the way. It delayed both filming and release. With fans not hooked up on the franchise, and disappointed with the second film, waiting for the third film sure wasn't good news... many people lost interest in the franchise as a whole already.

Secrets of Dumbledore was a nail in the coffin sadly. Unlike Crimes of Grindelwald, it was executed well, but the story itself just wasn't that good this time. Partly due to constant rewrites caused by covid, caused by actors entering online feuds with Rowling, Warner Bros and Rowling not being sure weather or not it will be the final installment of the franchise... it was received better than Crimes of Grindelwald, but still not good enough.

Secrets of Dumbledore failed at the box office (it did break even and maybe earn some money, but by Harry Potter standards, that's failure), due to people loosing interest in the franchise and the movie not being that good, again, second in a row in a franchise (due to different reasons though) that didn't hook up the fans to begin with... it was clear that after that Warner Bros will cancel the remaining films and move on. The movie did end on a kind of a final note, at least, leaving the story mostly concluded.

Side note: Rowling's online controversies had nothing to do with the franchise's failure imho. The vast majority of people just do not care about what people write on twitter (Rowling or anyone else, with Donald Trump and Elon Maks being maybe, and a huge maybe, the only exceptions).",movies

The problem for which I need advice is not so much that I can't decide which film to see, but that I constantly change my mind on how to decide what to see; it must be said that I am a bit obsessed with lists and therefore I keep changing my mind: first I wanted to see all the films of the most famous actors (after 3 films I changed my mind); then I wanted to see the films based on the year of released in order to make a sort of ranking of the films of that year (after 3 films I changed my mind); then I wanted to see all the films of all the directors of whom I had seen at least one film in order to make a list of directors which I made, taking a lot of hours (after 7/8 films I changed my mind); then I decided to watch films based on genres (after 3 films I changed my mind); then I decided to only see films by directors considered incredible because there is already little time, there are so many films to see and there is no point in seeing stuff that I probably won't like (this period lasted a while but then I realized that I was missing out on a lot of films or directors that perhaps I would have liked much more than the super famous ones considered the best directors, I changed my mind again); at this point I decided to watch films considered masterpieces regardless of the director but even in this case after a few films I changed my mind because I realized that perhaps I was missing out on better films and directors, or that in any case if I never watch bad films I won't I can really appreciate the good ones (and that after having seen a great film by a director I perhaps wanted to see his other films without following the rankings of the best films); then I decided to see all the films of some directors considered the best from first to last to understand how their cinema developed (here too, hours and hours of lists and research and after a few films I changed my mind); then I wanted to try to search for those unknown directors such as Thai or Brazilian and see all their films but after hours of research and lists I changed my mind because finding them was already difficult, even more so finding their films to see; then the desire to make films came back to me ranking by year and then I started again...etc.

 Each of these ideas has made me waste an incredible amount of hours that I willingly spend on the cinema, except that I'm not spending them on the cinema but on deciding what to see. Some of you are surely thinking that I should rather just randomly see a film that I want to see, but that's exactly the problem, since I'm very curious I want to see almost everything and so in the end I end up not seeing anything because I can't choose, so I get an idea on how to choose the films but after a while I change it and so I continue to waste time. 

It may certainly seem stupid to those who see cinema only as simple entertainment, but not to me who see it as a great passion and a great art that must be taken very seriously (obviously I don't mean that it shouldn't entertain).

Have any of you ever had a similar problem? What do you recommend me to do?",movies

never heard anything about before so that’s perfect

**PCU** and **Idle Hands** both in the queue as well as I’ve never seen em very much the sort under the radar(or my radar at least) suggestions I was hoping for.

Watching a guy use all of his knowledge of science, chemsitry and botany to survive against all odds on mars.

On top of this, it is also jam packed with memorable scenes. Moments of humor, tension, defeat, triumph and even a little heartfelt. AND amazing performances all around. Matt Damon carries the movie with style while all of the supporting cast bring their A game also. In particular, Jeff Daniels as the stern nasa director is an amazing performance

2gleggpj,1c8o7dm,1713614202.0,"What's a movie / saga, that inspired the biggest generations of kids into a job?","I work in Academia.  I don't have the numbers.  But maybe:

\- Jurassic Park inspired the greatest amount of kids into Paleontology, or-

\- Indiana Jones inspired the greatest amount of kids into Archeology, or-

\- Iron Man inspired the greatest amount of kids into Engineering, or-

\- Harry Potter Did Not inspire kids to want to move into magic, but conversely, inspired the greatest amount of kids into Writing.

I truly doubt a large amount of people grew up wanting to work in state security because of James Bond.  However, I do believe a lot of women grew up watching Clarice Starling (from ""The Silence of the Lambs"") wanting to work in police investigation, but not to a large extent.  Furthermore, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" could've inspired a generation of lawyers.

In regards to Television, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" could've inspired a lot of Baby Boomers to move into Police work.  Also ""Top Gear"" could've inspired a lot of people to move into car engineering.  And ""Grand Designs"" could've inspired a generation of Architects.

However, maybe, I think the biggest inspiration for the biggest impact for a generation of kids, would have to be ""Star Wars"", moving those kids into art, writing, collectibles and movie-making. ",movies
mut6n,1c8n5vr,1713610531.0,Are there any other sex/love scenes that are as important to the story as Mulholland Drive?,"Spoilers, yes. 

But I can't recall the use of sex scenes used ingeniously as Lynch did in this film, especially after you piece it together. 

The first one between Betty and Rita is so tender and passionate, but also so deeply tragic. It doesn't feel like Lynch incorporated this scene into the story to get his rocks off. He even digitally blurred Herring's nudity so it wasn't too explicit. 

The second one on the couch is cold, depressing, and clinical, and nothing romantic about it compared to the first one. It just feels desperate and sad. 

Leading then to the masturbation scene with Diane sobbing. her obsession taking over, not even doing it to get off, but trying to distract herself while realizing she'll never be loved or cared for the way she wants to. Then you get those blurry POV shots as her tears fill her eyes. 

None of this is gratuitous or erotic. It's just sad. I'd maybe include Blue Is The Warmest Color, which I love, but the sex in it could have been trimmed down a bit, or Don't Look Now where they make love while it's edited with them getting dressed, and taking a break from the trauma. 

Any other examples? ",movies

The only angle I can see for enjoying this movie is the meta-commentary on studio demands and sequel disease. But that doesn't justify 148 minutes.

There’s been so many real life huge explosions and natural disasters that have been caught on video.

Best Thing: Michael Clarke Duncan steals every damn scene he's in as Bear. Just great. (Very close second is the iconic Ben Affleck DVD commentary.)

Worst Thing: The obnoxious way Aerosmith has like 85 songs injected into the film. I don't know if this is fair or not, but at the time it was in theaters (and now) it seemed to cheapen Liv Tyler's performance that Aerosmith was so heavily saran-wrapped all over the film. She had already had several great roles before Armageddon (Empire Records / Stealing Beauty / That Thing You Do), but none of those were super widely seen. Then she's cast in Armageddon, which she definitely earned on the merits, and it would have been fine if there was one Aerosmith song, but the fact that there were like four in-your-face Aerosmith songs seemed to make it an oh-yeah-it's-the-Aerosmith-guy's-daughter thing.  Maybe I'm just resentful because this is the first time I've watched Armageddon since I saw her powerhouse performance in The Leftovers. 

To be clear, I'm fine with Aerosmith's music, some of which is great. It's just so damn gaudy in this film. Ugh. I need more dialogue like ""Independence is off the grid"" and less Aerosmith...",movies

I am a big horror guy so a bit biased but House of Wax is a legit great slasher. The cast is solid. The set design was cool. The deaths were inventive and the soundtrack is kind of a banger and then the finale was great when the wax mansion started to melt.

Lighting will still go outside at Maters orders by hearing outside and that results in him losing. he goes back to the Pits yells at Mater and then leaves to talk to reporters. It then has lighting and co reading Mater's note and then it continues with World Grand Prix Stuff. a cool event that happens is we get more than 3 races but the other races are minor. we even see some cars that are there to cheer for cars like we see Strip Weathers in the crowd, Chick Hicks and a bunch of other racers from all sorts of races. the second race happens like in the movie with the crashes but the audience doesn't know what is happening. the final race in London happens and during the race every racer is order to the pits and they get informed that due to complications Miles Axelrod was Arrested for Undisclosed reasons so because of that the World Grand Prix has been put on hold temporality. Lighting reunites with Mater who says to everyone that he is now a knight they don't believe him and  Lighting asks if this is one of his tall tales the movie ends with everyone back in Radiator Springs and Mater has left to do other things. meanwhile the World Grand Prix has been rebranded as the World Race Racing League that any car can join setting up a spinoff franchise involving races in that league. we see a car join the new league a car who claims that his the best car ever named Jackson Storm

for Cars 2: The Great Car Caper it is a spy action movie that sees Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell as a pair of Super Spies that are going after a group of evil cars. during the early days of Tokyo Mater accidently gets involved  when on a tour of something gets caught by an evil car who thinks that there is no way that his attitude is real and believes that he is a spy Holly and Finn Save him and immediately know that he is not a spy they give him a communicator to stay in touch if more villains come after him and go on their way during the first race Mater is kidnapped out of the stall and Finn and Holly save him and tell him to stay outside which he accidently says outside in his mic to lightning. Mater goes back to the pits and Lightning yells at him. Mater Disheartened decides to leave meanwhile the evil cars plot to kidnap Mater in the Airport and a spy contacts Finn and tells him Finn and Holly take Mater into protective Service when he is on his way to the Airport after writing his goodbye note. the Movie has Finn and Holley taking out villains with Mater just there to provide commentary . he does recognize the Big Bad's voice as Axelrod and reveals it to the Queen and then it its announced that the World Grand Prix is postponed by the Head of British Intelligence Mater is Knighted by the Queen and then catches a flight and reunites with McQueen who Mater tries to say he had an adventure but nobody believes him.

5hpq24rk,1c8d33v,1713574440.0,Question about Wind River (2017),"So I recently rewatched Wind River. And it's still incredible. But there was one scene that stood out to me as distinctly different from the first time I watched it. 
During the medical examiner's scene, Elizabeth Olson's performance was more reserved. I feel like I'm going crazy but in the version I watched, she was a lot more passionate and was very shaken by seeing the body. I'm wondering if there were two different versions of this scene and why the director would choose one over the other. I really think the original version I saw adds more to Olson's character by making her seem more naive and out of her depth. Anybody else notice this or is this one of those false memory type things?

EDIT: I might've seen an early cut of the movie because the version I saw definitely didn't show the scene where Bernthal's character saves his gf from the rape. It cuts right from when they notice she's unconscious back to the present and the rape is only implied.

EDIT 2: So apparently I'm not to only person to notice this. The Version I originally saw had Korean subtitles (there are clips on youtube from this version). It also featured all three coyotes being shot and killed by Renner's character in the beginning of the movie. I saw some people saying this was also the version they saw screened at Sundance when the movie was released so turns out I'm not crazy, there are apparently at least 2 cuts of this movie.",movies

vxmznh8n,1cd47qi,1714082934.0,American History X had a really bad ending,"So, I just watched the film, knew it was a classic so I thought it'd be super interesting, if bleak.

But, the ending just seems to suck. I thought throughout the film it was going to have a pretty clear ending, because it wasn't going to end happily: Danny or Derek was going to be killed in a drive-by shooting by a group of Crips.

This seemed like the obvious tragic ending. Hate begets hate, as is the film's strong theme, and tragically, Danny was too late in escaping the life of violence and hatred he had chosen, and he or his family suffered the consequence.

But, instead, Danny is killed... by a bully he confronted earlier? In a scene that was less ""Racial hatred"" and much more ""Standing up to a bully to help a bullied kid."" Standing up to the bully is what we'd want of a good, well-raised child, it's not a sign of a hate-filled kid.

And for the life of me, I can't figure out what they were going for there. Why would the tragedy stem from THAT, of all things? If you wanted the shooting to stem from the fact that Danny had taught Derek to be hateful, why wouldn't the killing stem from a confrontation where Derek was, y'know, in the wrong, and being blatantly racist, rather than blowing smoke in the face of a bully to help someone else?

Just seemed like a real let down, where the themes didn't work out whatsoever.",movies

Some thoughts:

a. I would say it's a real come back if he made no films at all during his 'quiet' years. 

b. During his 'quiet' years did he take on these lesser roles by choice (to stay active in the industry) or not (to pay bills)?

Oh, another one I really liked was ""Hacksaw Ridge"", apparently the directors had to cut out some of the story/scenes, cause it was just ""too unbelievable"". It's normally never like that, it's always the other way around.

War dogs was also pretty great, but on a totally different level, It was dramatized as fuck obviously, but it also showed some stuff that can be verified, so it's at least based on a true story.

i6bon,1ccyvps,1714070315.0,How do you rate movies?,"I've been thinking a lot recently on how I review films and why I give them the ratings I do.

This largely boils down to much weight you put towards enjoyment vs film analysis when rating a movie.

By film analysis, I refer to the standards we hold in regards to what we think a ""good"" film should contain. Not that I think film analysis is objective, but I think there are well established principles in relation to storytelling and cinema that I take seriously, and I apply them when critiquing a movie.

I think one of the most obvious examples of this dilemma is The Room. A film which I think most of us would agree fails on most levels of film analysis, but many get a tremendous amount of enjoyment from. How do you rate that?

The more I document my film scores on sites like letterboxd the more I come around to the position that the worst thing a movie can be is bland. Movies that I have rated 4 or 5 out of 10 and that I remember absolutely nothing of, with no intent to return to.

Some of the marketing even kind of implied that he was the villain or evil in some way. But all he does is be really persistent in trying to convince John Cusack's character from not staying in the evil room...and he's not wrong obviously. Like the worst thing you can say about him is that his motives are a bit selfish and he's mostly concerned with the hotel's reputation, but what he wants is better for both the hotel and Cusack. And the worst thing he does is maybe try to outright bribe Cusack from staying there? But that's maybe just a little shady, but it's not even illegal in this context.

ic1yd0ck,1cclcdr,1714027842.0,Thoughts on Sergei Eisenstein?,"It makes me upset how unknown this guy is nowadays. One of the most important directors of all time, and one of the few directors who was also a theorist and a philosopher. 

Eisenstein changed my perception of cinema. Before I saw cinema as strictly narrative, but now I realize it doesn’t have to be (though Dziga Vertov also influenced this change in mind) 

I hope this post made at least some people want to see his films. If so please don’t start with “Battleship Potemkin.” While that is his most famous film, it’s also his second worst film imo (worst one being Alexander Nevsky) This doesn’t mean its bad, Potemkin is still quite revolutionary, its just not as good as his other films. I think the best way to experience Eisenstein is to watch his films in release order. (He only has 8 films) If you dont have time then I suggest this order: 

1- Strike (1924)
2- October (1927)
3- Ivan the Terrible Part I (1944) (His best film imo)
4- Ivan the Terrible Part II (1947/1958) (It was finished after his death)
5- Que Viva Mexico (There are different versions of this film.Eisenstein shot the footage but never finished editing)
6- General Line / Old and New (1929)
7- Battleship Potemkin (1925)
8- Alexander Nevsky (1938) 

Again all of his films are amazing, so Nevsky is only bad in relation to others.  

I think you can find them on youtube.

There’s so much to talk about him but its getting late (3 am lol)

vr1ei4,1ccjm1t,1714021326.0,What are your thoughts on animation in the West?,"TLDR: 

What have been your experiences in discussions of Animation with others? 

Do you think it is taken seriously in the West? if not, why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Whenever it comes to the discussion of animation, I am noticing very different attitude between people in the West in comparison to the East. This difference also seems more pronounced when looking at America.

The idea being that Animation, especially films, are for children. I don’t see it taken very seriously as a medium for storytelling

On the other end of the spectrum of *“Only for kids”*, there seems to be the attitude that any animation for adults should be black comedy. Popular examples such as; Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Rick and Morty, etc.

But Within the past few years there has been a boom in popular animated series aimed more towards adults which handle more emotionally mature topics and treat the storylines with sincerity rather than having a focus on dark humor; Castlevania, Primal, Cyberpunk, Arcane, Primal, Invincible, Blue Eye Samurai, Hazbin Hotel, Vox Machina, etc. 

Yet, despite the massive success of these series, in recent discussions I have had with others - I still see people who either don’t have any respect for animation as a storytelling medium or just don’t see the possibility of it being more successful if given the chance.

Disney has been remaking all of their classic animated films into live action, and although there are some voices who ask “why?” The films are still box office successes for the most part, or they would not keep making them. However people still ask “Why make live action versions of films that were already great?”

Netflix has recently been remaking popular animated works such as the previously mentioned Cowboy Bebop, One Piece, and Avatar the Last Airbender. All of which triggered various discussions about the artistic value of recreating something into live action when it was already good. 

It just seems like there is this dislike towards animation both in the industry and from audiences. Meanwhile Japan released 76 animated films for Theaters in 2022 alone.

**But I am curious about what has been your experience in discussing Animation with other people and what your thoughts are about attitudes towards animation in the West compared to the East.**",movies

This movie really helped me feel emotions I had buried deep within. It helped me gain my confidence in myself back. It helped me start to care about my life more and do the work it takes to love myself and care for myself. I realized things you choose in life doesn’t matter (they do, but you can’t change the past) because the best outcome will always find a way to come into fruition.

Now I'm only halfway through the movie (it's like four hours holy shit) and I know Ti West said he drew influence from GWTW's glorification of ""The Lost Cause"" and of southern slavery, mirroring it with Pearl's glorification of Hollywood and all its exploitation. 

But I wonder if Pearl was based off Scarlett herself. What do you think? 

Edit: I'm not sure why I'm getting downvoted on this post 😭 I can acknowledge that Pearl is obviously her own character and the movie mirrors the Wizard of Oz more than anything. I just found the petulant nature of her to look really similar to Scarlett, is all. I am aware that we can't tell for sure what Ti West was thinking when filming Pearl, but I was just curious to see if anyone else thought of Scarlett as well. 

And I finished the film!! It was crazy!!! I can appreciate how innovative it was in 1939, even if its message is very flawed and its portrayal of life is a white-washed glorification of a really terrible time in American history.

xt0g45c17,1ccgnwp,1714011788.0,Barbie Monologue vs Monster Monologue ,"I recently watched the Barbie movie and then saw I rewatched Patty Jenkin’s Monster. 

I just feel like the movie Monster does a better job of depicting ills of modern society— poverty, abuse, misogyny, America’s invisible poor, mental illness facing women than the Barbie movie. It has more to say and is goddamn fantastic filmmaking. 

I know it’s apples and oranges to compare the two movies. Yes, the Barbie movie is for families and is Feminism-lite and is a toy movie, but let’s have some fun!

Aileen : SAYS WHO? I'm good with the Lord. I'm fine with him. And I know how you were raised, alright? And I know how people fuckin' think out there, and fuck, it's gotta be that way. They've gotta tell you that 'Thou shall not kill' shit and all of that. But that's not the way the world works, Selby. Cuz I'm out there every fuckin' day living it. Who the fuck knows what God wants? People kill each other every day and for what? Hm? For politics, for religion, and THEY'RE HEROES! No, no... there's a lot of shit I can't do anymore, but killing's not one of them. And letting those fucking bastards go out and rape someone else isn't either!

Gloria: Is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.

You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood.

But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.

I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know.

qbfandkj0,1ccgk94,1714011498.0,Most Violent/Gory Movies,"What would be the most violent, gory and bloody movies you've ever seen? They can be of any genre, and this would of course be counting the completely uncut, uncensored and unedited versions of any films that have such versions. I won't be counting war films as I feel it's not fair to compare fictional staged violence to something re-creating real-life events.

I think the all-time most violent, gory and bloody movies I've seen would be in no particular order:

* Dead-Alive (AKA BrainDead)
* Day Of The Dead (1985)
* Hardcore Henry
* Natural Born Killers
* Ichi The Killer
* Re-Animator
* The Thing (John Carpenter's 1982 remake)
* The Evil Dead (both the original and 2013 remake)
* Terrifier 2 (honorable mention to the original Terrifier)
* Hellbound: Hellraiser II (honorable mention to the original as well)
* Maniac (1980)
* The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning
* Demons (1985)
* ChromeSkull: Laid To Rest 2
* Autopsy (2008)
* Versus (2000)
* Riki-Oh: The Story Of Ricky

Terrifier 2 is easily one of the most brutally violent, blood-soaked movies to come out in years. I can't say I'm surprised some moviegoers fainted in theaters. There's one particular kill scene in it (won't spoil it but if you've seen the film I'm sure you know which I'm referring to, happening to a particular character at her home) that in just that one scene alone had enough graphic gore and bloodletting for a dozen other films.

Event Horizon came close to making this list as well and if we ever get the original uncut version (which reportedly had a whopping 17 minutes of extra-gory footage excised to avoid an NC-17 rating), I bet it would. Pretty astounding to think 17 whole minutes had to be cut to avoid an NC-17 rating.",movies
sxlv38sl,1ccgh4k,1714011237.0,Movies with a true antihero?,"Not sure why this occurred to me today. Something got me to thinking about movies that might have a true antihero. Maybe my definition is too tight—this is a character that is truly a bad guy. Most movies (and tv shows) really dance around this, generally showing the character with positive traits that make him redeemable, or having him turn around during the course of the movie. 

Dexter (this is tv not movie of course) is a great example of whitewashing the anti hero. The books explored more of the sadistic serial killer side of him. But HBO turned him into more of an almost justified vengeful superhero.

Are there any true antihero movies? Where the main character is just a bad unlikable guy, through and through, all the way to the end?

Edit: lots of great responses! Loved the post on Inglorious Basterds. These were psychopaths sent to do a “good” mission—kill Hitler and end the war. And the did it like the murderous psychopaths they were!  Are there any more like this?

56u37dg2,1ccbo9s,1713997834.0,Best acting in silence?,"A good part of acting tends to come from the voice. Being able to convey emotion, passion, brilliant writing and any number of things is helped exponentially when an actor can speak. However, some of the best acting I’ve found can come when an actor doesn’t have their voice to rely on. Conveying all that emotion and passion with just your face and body is no easy feat, but when it’s pulled off it can be utterly incredible. So what are some of the best times an actor pulled off a scene without uttering a single word?

Of the two examples I have, the first is interesting. Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit already had an incredibly difficult job, acting against something that wasn’t there. But in the scene where Judge Doom reveals what he is, there’s this one shot of Hoskins where he looks utterly terrified and traumatised seeing his brothers killer right in front of him. It’s very quick but it’s such a marvellous moment.

The other is actually from television but is no less fantastic. In the Doctor Who episode Vincent and the Doctor, Tony Curran’s wordless performance as Vincent Van Gogh when they visit the museum of his work at the end is utterly heartbreakingly beautiful. Just seeing Vincent, a man who suffered from extreme depression, self doubt and pain, see his work being not just praised but (through Bill Nighy’s monologue about the impact of his work) held in the highest possible regard, Currans portrayal is just incredible.

The daughter was murdered by unknown person? But the police thought Francis committed his own daughter murder but was released because they caught the person who actually did it. Local people went into a hunt to find the missing body. This includes Eric, the dj and spokesperson at Exotica club and Christina, the dancer. That’s where they both met and found Francis daughter deceased body. 

The wife of Francis was having an affair with his brother. The guy in the wheelchair. It was confirmed sort of when they got into a car accident. The wife got killed but his brother survived resulting him to be in a wheelchair. 

Furthermore, Francis pays his brother daughter to “babysit” when in reality his daughter is not there anymore. She babysits no one. He likes the rides back with his niece because it brought him that feeling back of when he did it with Christina. 

Overall, I’m just confused

• did francis kill his daughter or not?

• why did Christina end up a dancer? 

• was Francis the biological father of his own “daughter” or  was it his brother? 

• why was the dj Eric, so obsessed with christina? 

• what’s up with the Thomas? He’s a smuggler and gay.

3ta26jz5,1ccasw2,1713995651.0,Challengers. My humble opinion.,"Are we talking about tennis? It's not just a recurring line from the movie. It's basically the whole theme of it. Cuz this movie is always about tennis. It's about tennis when they're actually playing tennis and it's about tennis when they're playing whatever the hell's going on between the three of them.

And, well, I guess you could argue winning at life could go through the same means and towards the same results of winning at tennis: dedication, passion, strength, pride, success, and, the most important one, making the right decisions. And you don't always do. That's the point. This is a drama about three people growing up and trying to achieve all of those, with variable results, of course. Is the resulting story enthralling? I happened to find it quite fascinating, yeah, but you be the judge.

It's undeniably majestically acted by all three of the au pair protagonists and it's a celebration. I mean a celebration of the obsession you could have about playing with a small yellow ball, as well as the one you could feel towards a woman's allure. It's a celebration of the jaw dropping beauty of Zendaya. it's, mostly, a celebration of the beauty of the sport, and that's particularly shown by the fact that it's not shot by playing it safe. It is, instead, a continuous exercise in trying to find the most spectacular way to portray every possible hit of the ball. It reminded me a lot of how the energy of the hits exudes so much from the pages of Happy! by Urasawa (and, now that I think of it, that story is a tennis love triangle too). Many of other shots are good too, the way they're framed is always meaningful of something. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing, albeit sometimes it may be a little overwhelming, I suppose that was deliberate.

One thing to know before you watch: please note that, to fully comprehend all the different nuances explored about the different worlds involved, you gotta look at this film exactly like a coach would observe her player during a match, paying attention to all the small details.

The best comedies are the ones where you notice new jokes each time or some punchlines work better when you hear them again, but some just get old quick.

vxmznh8n,1cd47qi,1714082934.0,American History X had a really bad ending,"So, I just watched the film, knew it was a classic so I thought it'd be super interesting, if bleak.

But, the ending just seems to suck. I thought throughout the film it was going to have a pretty clear ending, because it wasn't going to end happily: Danny or Derek was going to be killed in a drive-by shooting by a group of Crips.

This seemed like the obvious tragic ending. Hate begets hate, as is the film's strong theme, and tragically, Danny was too late in escaping the life of violence and hatred he had chosen, and he or his family suffered the consequence.

But, instead, Danny is killed... by a bully he confronted earlier? In a scene that was less ""Racial hatred"" and much more ""Standing up to a bully to help a bullied kid."" Standing up to the bully is what we'd want of a good, well-raised child, it's not a sign of a hate-filled kid.

And for the life of me, I can't figure out what they were going for there. Why would the tragedy stem from THAT, of all things? If you wanted the shooting to stem from the fact that Danny had taught Derek to be hateful, why wouldn't the killing stem from a confrontation where Derek was, y'know, in the wrong, and being blatantly racist, rather than blowing smoke in the face of a bully to help someone else?

Just seemed like a real let down, where the themes didn't work out whatsoever.",movies

It is a horror movie shot in Petaluma that came out in 1999. I cannot find an online source to watch it! In attempts to procure a physical copy, I visited the Petaluma Visitors Center (nice ladies, but they had not heard of it). At the visitors center we looked through a list of ""movies shot in Sonoma County"" stretching back to 1913 and Incident at Haystack Landing was not on the list. The next day, I visited the Petaluma Historical Library and Museum. The docent there had indeed heard of the movie, but they did not have a copy (she was only able to print the IMDB page off the internet for me, which was a very nice gesture). I then visited Copperfield's book store in downtown hoping they'd have a movie section, but they did not.

My questions are has anyone seen this movie, and does anyone here know where I can watch it? Also, if there are any more likely spots in the Sonoma County area that may have a copy (museums, archives, old video stores, etc), I would love to hear ideas. Thanks so much in advance!",movies

* JH is definitely coming back to the mainstream with Oppenheimer and Trap. But I see in his filmography that he's been consistently working almost every year since his first film in 1998. Though perhaps in non-mainstream and lesser known films during the last 15-20 years.

Some thoughts:

a. I would say it's a real come back if he made no films at all during his 'quiet' years. 

b. During his 'quiet' years did he take on these lesser roles by choice (to stay active in the industry) or not (to pay bills)?

* Dark Waters
* Dumb Money
* The Greatest Beer Run

These are 3 different aspects, #1 health, #2 money, #3 beer in war? idk how to classify this, it has a unique story telling.

Going by these titles, if you've seen them all, you probably also notice that I do like a good ending, in this case, an ending where the random guy on the street ends up being the winner, sometimes not short term, but they might change laws worldwide long term.

Oh, another one I really liked was ""Hacksaw Ridge"", apparently the directors had to cut out some of the story/scenes, cause it was just ""too unbelievable"". It's normally never like that, it's always the other way around.

War dogs was also pretty great, but on a totally different level, It was dramatized as fuck obviously, but it also showed some stuff that can be verified, so it's at least based on a true story.

&#x200B;

Any recommendations for these types of movies? Basically the kind of movies I'm looking for is.

* REAL story
* The small guy wins in the end (even if he doesn't win personally, it might be a win for his people or people in his same poor situation of life)
* The little people against the big corps or big gov that can make changes
* A bit of humor in the movie is appreciated

Give me the most random amount of movies that are at least somewhat based on a true story or a very longterm legend that's been seen a truth in your region/country. There's probably at least a few rom-coms that are in line with some of these things, just don't let it be hallmark. Hallmark is just too produced, it has no credibility whatsoever.",movies

i6bon,1ccyvps,1714070315.0,How do you rate movies?,"I've been thinking a lot recently on how I review films and why I give them the ratings I do.

This largely boils down to much weight you put towards enjoyment vs film analysis when rating a movie.

By film analysis, I refer to the standards we hold in regards to what we think a ""good"" film should contain. Not that I think film analysis is objective, but I think there are well established principles in relation to storytelling and cinema that I take seriously, and I apply them when critiquing a movie.

I think one of the most obvious examples of this dilemma is The Room. A film which I think most of us would agree fails on most levels of film analysis, but many get a tremendous amount of enjoyment from. How do you rate that?

The more I document my film scores on sites like letterboxd the more I come around to the position that the worst thing a movie can be is bland. Movies that I have rated 4 or 5 out of 10 and that I remember absolutely nothing of, with no intent to return to. There are movies I've rated far lower that were at least memorable and made me feel something.

Please share your own thought process behind this.",movies
